## Unveiling the Lineage: Abhinavagupta's Homage and the Kaula Connection

So last time, we got up to verse 9, I think, of the introduction. We're moving very slowly. I'm doing an essay on each of the verses, essentially, here. 

And now, having done that rather rich verse which acknowledged Maheśvara and Bhūtirāja, he turns to address Somānanda, Utpaladeva, and Lakṣmaṇagupta, his predecessors in the exegesis of the Pratyabhijñā corpus of texts. These were gurus of the Trika lineage, to which he made obeisance earlier in the introduction. But in that verse, he didn't mention names. Now he explicitly mentions the names of Somānanda, Utpaladeva, and Lakṣmaṇagupta. And, in fact, he does that in the next two verses, 10 and 11, and that's all I'll try to cover today. 

So he's turning again to those he called "the pearls of the Trika lineage" that he addressed in the eighth verse. And this time, he's naming them – from Somānanda to Lakṣmaṇagupta – and by implication, rather than explicitly, adding himself to their number, as we will see. 

So the two verses are as follows: 

> śrīsomānandabodhā- śrīmat-utpalaviśṛtā jayanti samvidāmoda- sandarbha-dikprasarpiṇāḥ || 10 || 
>
> tadāsvāda- *parāveśa*- *bṛṃhitāṃ* matiṃ *ṣaṭpadīm* guror lakṣmaṇaguptasya nāda-sammohiniṃ namaḥ || 11 || 

***Jayanti*** – Supreme are, perhaps I should make this point yet again. Indologists have been translating *jayanti* and *jayante* as "victorious is" or "victorious are" for generations now. It's a mistake. *Ji* here is used in the sense of "being supreme", not defeating anybody, not having victory over anyone, just being *sarvātṛṣṭa*. So, the common gloss of *jayati* is *sarvotkṛṣṭo* *bhavati* or *sarvotkarṣeṇa* *vartate* or similar gloss. And you find this throughout Sanskrit literature, it's not just a habit of the Kashmiri exegetes. It's seen everywhere, in Buddhist, Jaina, and Brahmanical literature. So, *jayanti* means "supreme are", and what are supreme? 

The *samvidāmoda-sandarbhaḥ* – the compositions, *sandarbhaḥ*, the works of *śāstra*, *sandarbhaḥ* – that have come forth *viniśṛtāḥ*, that have been emitted by, that have come forth from Śrīmad-utpalaḥ, The venerable Utpalaḥ, namely, Utpaladeva, the author of the core text of the Pratyabhijñā corpus, whose awareness, whose enlightenment, whose *bodhā* – this is *aparokṣī* here as I understand it – *śrīmat-* *śrī-somānanda-* *bodhā* *śrīmad-utpalaḥ*, whose enlightenment is from Somānanda, in other words, who owes his enlightenment to the teachings of his guru, Somānanda. These compositions, which are *samvidāmoda-sandarbhaḥ*, which are compositions whose fragrance, that possess the exquisite fragrance of enlightenment, of *samvit*, of enlightened awareness, *samvidāmoda-sandarbhaḥ*, spreading in all directions *dikprasarpiṇaḥ*. 

*Dik* means "in all ten directions," or perhaps only in eight, since going up or down isn't much use when it comes to disseminating knowledge. 

Now. So supreme are the compositions that have come forth, filled with enlightenment's fragrance, from the venerable Utpala, when he had been awakened by the venerable Somānanda, spreading far and wide, *dikprasarpiṇaḥ*. 

And then there's a double meaning here, as so often in these uh *kāvya*-style verses. Though it be *śāstra*, this doesn't prevent Abhinavagupta from using literary artifice. So there's a second meaning here, which indicates a comparison through double meanings. 

So, spreading far and wide like – I'm allowing the word "like" here – like the fragrance released by the beautiful water lily *śrīmad-utpalaḥ*, when it awakens in delight, *ānandabodhā*, when it awakens, being made joyful *ānanda-* *ānandabodhā*, by the moon, i.e., at the touch of the rays of the moon. 

So, let me read that again with the second meaning: Supreme are the compositions that have come forth, filled with enlightenment's fragrance, from the venerable Utpala, when he had been awakened by the venerable Somānanda, spreading far and wide like the fragrance released by the beautiful water lily, when it awakes in delight at the touch of the rays of the moon. 

The second verse. 

> *tadāsvāda-parāveśa-bṛṃhitāṃ* *matiṃ* *ṣaṭpadīm* *guroh* *lakṣmaṇaguptasya* *nāda-sammohiniṃ* *namaḥ* || 11 || 

*Namaḥ*, uh I praise, of course, it's literally "we praise," but by the conventions of the etiquette of *śāstra*, the plural is used in the inclusive sense. It's a polite "I," not a royal plural. 

I praise, *namaḥ*, *naumi* in other words, the intellect, *mati*, *matiṃ* *ṣaṭpadīm*, literally "the intellect bee". There's another metaphor coming in. The intellect of my teacher Lakṣmaṇagupta, *guroh* *lakṣmaṇaguptasya* *matiṃ* *ṣaṭpadīm*, *namaḥ*. I praise the bee, which is the intellect of my teacher Lakṣmaṇagupta, which entrances *sammohiniṃ*, which intoxicates or entrances *sammohiniṃ*, makes me confused, puts me into an ecstasy, *sammohiniṃ*, with the *nāda*, the inarticulate or deep resonance, humming, *nāda-* *sammohiniṃ*, of its understanding, like a bee within that lily. This is the conventional approach, the bee is trapped inside the lily. You hear it buzzing, roused by its immersion in the full relish of that fragrance. 

*tadāsvāda-parāveśa-* *bṛṃhitāṃ* *matiṃ* *ṣaṭpadīm*. Literally, "I praise that bee of the intellect of my guru, Lakṣmaṇagupta, which has been nourished, *bṛṃhitām*, nourished, strengthened, by *āveśa*, immersion, in the intensity *parā*, *parā*, of relishing that, *tadāsvāda*, that wonderful fragrance emitted by the lotus, which is the – rather than "water lily" – which is Utpaladeva's enlightened state. 

And I take this attribute *nāda-sammohiniṃ* as what the *śās-* what the, in *śāstra* we would call a *hetu-viśeṣaṇa*, *heto-viśeṣaṇam*, uh an attribute which explains a reason. So, in my translation, I've therefore allowed myself a new sentence here. For that, in turn, now entrances me with the deep resonance, understand, of its understanding, of its knowledge, its understanding, like a bee within that lily. This is the conventional approach, the bee is trapped inside the lily, you hear it buzzing, roused by its immersion in the full relish of that fragrance. 

Now, the first of these two verses pays tribute to Utpaladeva, disciple of Somānanda, as the author of the principle philosophical texts of the Pratyabhijñā doctrine. And you have those on your handout, on page three, item five towards the bottom of that page. 

Let me just quickly tell you what those texts are. 

The root text is the *Īśvara-pratyabhijñā-kārikā*, the root verses on the recognition of self as the deity. *Īśvara-pratyabhijñā-* *kārikā*, which means not, um, contracting the deity to the dimensions of one's own ego, but the other way around. Um recognizing that what you cling to as yourself is an epiphenomenon, that its true core is this omnipotent and totally creative force, which is Śiva or Bhairava. So, *kārikā* means the root verses or the expository verses of the recognition of God, *Īśvara-pratyabhijñā-kārikā*, sometimes simply called *Īśvara-pratyabhijñā-* *sūtram*, *sūtrāṇi*, the *sūtra*s of uh *Īśvara-pratyabhijñā*. 

Now, on this root text in verse, Utpaladeva wrote two commentaries. Uh, one, a straightforward *vṛtti*, which is a kind of paraphrase, an explanatory prose exposition of what is contained in those verses, and the other, a much more elaborate commentary, a *vivr̥ti*, is the, uh, the third item on that handout: *īśvara-pratyabhijñā-kārikā-* *vivr̥ti*, which, sadly, has been largely lost. 

We have a couple of fragmentary manuscripts, uh, parts of it, and some serious work in recent years has been done by a pupil of mine to identify fragments or parts that have been lifted from this commentary uh found in *marginalia* in manuscripts of the works that do survive. 

So, that project is ongoing, and I think in due course, we'll find more fragments. But then they turn out to be extremely interesting. They contain arguments which are not found in the, in the *kārikā* or in the *kārikā-vṛtti*. And, uh, on those two works, the rather on the first and the third, we have commentaries by Abhinavagupta. The *Īśvara-pratyabhijñā-vimārśinī* is a commentary directly on the *kārikā*s, and then we have his *vivr̥ti-vimārśinī*, an enormous work which he completed in 1015 AD, the *vivr̥ti-vimārśinī*. 

And it's sad that we don't have access to a complete manuscript of the *vivr̥ti* because actually sorting out in the manuscripts of the *vivr̥ti-vimārśinī*, this vast text, what is *lemma* and what is commentary is not easy because, of course, the scribes avoided any such useful conventions as underlining or bold characters or, you know, just, you just get a text from beginning to end and good luck. 

Even word divisions, as you know, are not noted. Why waste space? Yeah. Which leads me to think that scribes paid for the paper. That's the word. 

So, then we have other works by Utpala. We have a commentary by him on his teacher Somānanda's *Śivadṛṣṭi*, It's *Śivadṛṣṭi-vṛtti*. And then we have three small Siddhi texts – small proofs, philosophical treatises. 

Uh, I'll do the last first – *_Īśvara_siddhi*. This, in a way, is the least interesting. It's a proof of the existence of God, but there's nothing to differentiate that proof from the kind of proof that a Siddhāntaika would offer. In fact, Siddhāntaika authors have cited it for their uh theism. 

The other two are much more specific to this Pratyabhijñā tradition. The *_Ajñāna_-paramārtha-siddhi* – proof of a sentient agent of cognition against the Buddhists, of course. And *_Sambandha_-siddhi* – proof that there are real relations other than mere succession through causality, again, an attack at Buddhist on Buddhist reductionism. Consciousness is the uniter, the creator of relations and the separator of relations. The idea that there's just a plurality of uh of of an of events connected by causality is seen, I think rightly, as a reductionist view and demonstrated rather effectively in that treatise.

So those are the works that are being referred to here.

Now, Abhinavagupta uses Utpala – the abbreviated form of Utpaladeva's name – in a play on the word, on the meaning, *_utpala_* or *_utpalam_*, for that denotes a water lily of the genus _nymphaea_, not to be confused with the lotus, though often it's referred to as a blue lotus. This is a misnomer. Um, and in fact, it seems in my understanding of this verse to be a nocturnal variety that opens its petals from sunset to mid-morning during the days of its flowering, releasing an intense fragrance. It's famous for the intensity of its scent. In fact, at some point, the court of Kashmir made a gift of these flowers – I don't know how they got them intact all the way to China, but they gave it to the Tang court. And there's a notice on these saying that these flowers had arrived and how amazing they were and you could pick up the scent from several tens of paces away. So they're very heady, intense uh scent. And that's why I think Abhinavagupta has chosen this because the blue lo- the uh the lotus proper is fragrant but not so intensely fragrant.

So Abhinavagupta has in mind a night-flowering variety, is suggested by the word _soma_ that forms the first part of Somananda's name. For while it has other meanings, it is also one of the numerous words meaning moon. And it is moonlight that was believed to cause these flowers to open, just as it's believed that the rays of the sun open the day lotus and indeed the day water lilies; the rays of the moon were believed to be causing the opening, the anthesis, of the of the night-blooming water lily. Yeah.

So I have construed the words _śrī-somananda_- bodha as having two meanings, one referring to Utpala and one to the water lily, which is a comparison – illumination of what's below through comparison. Taking the latter – the application to the water lily – to mean when it opens in joy at the touch of the moon. He conveys that just as the rays of the moon's beams, the rays of the moon, cause the nocturnal water lily to open its petals and release a penetrating fragrance that spreads in all directions, so Somananda's instruction awakened the dormant awareness of Utpala, causing it to release the fragrance of enlightened consciousness in the form of these widely disseminated works. 

And of course by saying _dig-prasara_, he's not thinking, "Well, they spread to every corner of the Kashmir Valley," which is about the size of the county of Kent. It's a tiny area! He is obviously referring to the fact that these texts, by even in his time, had achieved considerable fame and were, as it were, well, an export that Kashmiri intellectuals could be proud of. They were being studied beyond the confines of their community. 

They do indeed present a particularly powerful refutation of Buddhist epistemology and ontology at a time when those disciplines had reached a very high level of sophistication. And Nyāya and the other old disciplines, tied as they were to their original agenda set forth in their root texts, didn't really have the muscle to deal with it. 

The Śaivas had the great advantage that they came along later and could ref- could formulate their basic principles free of the shackles of Nyāya, of the Nyāya system and the Vaiśeṣika system, and design their their view of the self, etc., in a way that didn't fall into the trap of the naive realism of the early centuries of the Christian era, as Brahmanical thinking began to gear up and formulate its position against the heretics, as it were. 

I shouldn't use the word "heretics" because a heretic is an insider who doesn't agree with you. These are people following other religious traditions which were seen as posing a serious threat to the presuppositions of Brahmanical injunction. And notice that I say injunction because that was what it was really about. 

The problem with Buddhism is not that it had a metaphysics that didn't correspond to the Upaniṣads. It's that, by its very nature, it undermines the ability to have faith in Vedic injunction. That's the real cause of the problem, I think. It's not metaphysics so much as undermining the authority of injunction embodied in the Veda. 

So this likening of a teacher's awakening his disciple's awareness to the moonlight's opening the closed petals of a night-flowering _nymphaea_ is a variant of a more common motif, uh with a more common motif that which compares this awakening to the opening of the petals of the Asian or sacred lotus, the _nelumbo nucifera_, when touched in the morning by the rays of the sun. 

We will see Abhinavagupta describing his own awakening as a disciple of Śambhunātha in these terms in verse 21 of the introduction at the end of this preface. And Kṣemarāja uses the same metaphor when acknowledging his debt to Abhinavagupta. He says in his commentary on the _Svacchanda_:

> Abhinavabodhāditya-jyoti-vikāsita-hṛt-saroja unme rasāyataḥ sa-rasā-pari-mala-masāra-saṁsāra- vāsanā-śāntyai

"You who know the rapture of awareness, relish the fragrance from the lotus of my heart that is opened wide in the light of the sun that is the enlightened consciousness of Abhinavagupta, in order that you may free yourselves forever from the influence of this worthless state of bound existence."

Yeah. His devotion to Abhinavagupta is palpable, I think, in that in that verse. 

Against the hypothesis that Abhinavagupta has in mind a night-blooming um uh a night-blooming variety of water lily might be urged the fact that bees do not visit any variety of _nymphaea_ during the hours of darkness. This, I'm afraid, is a fact. Um well, I I'm no scientist, no biologist, no entomologist, but from what I can see from what I've read, this is seen as a fact. Bees are attracted to the nocturnal water lily during the days of its anthesis, its flowering, but only during the early hours of the morning before they close again, not during the hours of darkness when the only that the only pollinators to visit them are flying beetles. Not quite so poetic. 

But this objection carries no weight since the idea that bees are attracted at night to night-blooming water lilies – wrong though it is – is a commonplace of Sanskrit poetry. Thus a verse attributed to Bhartṛhari Vikramāditya speaks of the _nymphaea_ flowers being invisible in the darkness but revealed both by the buzzing of the bees drawn to them and by the fragrance they release. You can hear them and smell them. You can hear the bees revealing their presence and you can smell them through the fragrance. And the notion that bees visit flowers during the hours of darkness is seen throughout Sanskrit poetry. It's a very common trope. And I think I've given you some examples of that on your handout. 

Um yes, at the top of page 3, I think. Here you have the notion that it is moonbeams that cause nocturnal water lilies to open their petals; that's there. And under an item four, three and four, we have some further support for the underlying beliefs about flowers that make this verse mean what I think it means. 

I've pointed out that the use of the word _bodha_, which you might think is odd for the opening of a flower, is actually well-attested in Sanskrit poetry. The awakening of a flower is opening its petals. So that's a commonplace, and I've given you some references and actually reproduced the text.

And then for the idea that the heavenly bodies – the sun and the moon – delight these flowers and that it's the bliss of this delight that causes them to open is also a trope of Sanskrit poetry. And I've given you some uh one reference there from the _Mahābhāṣita-saṅgraha_ um which which is referring in this case to the sun – _ānandayantaṃ aravinda-vanāni_ – delighting the fields of lotuses. I've written "forests". It's not really a forest of lotuses. It's a field of lotuses. 

So I think it's fairly clear that he does intend this metaphor in in in those terms.

Now. Yeah, I've just added here what I've already stated earlier, which is that indebted though Utpaladeva was to his teacher's *Śivadṛṣṭi*, his works have a brilliance and clarity that fully justify Abhinavagupta's making him the center of his focus in this pair of verses, Somananda being mentioned only as the source of his understanding rather than receiving a verse of his own. No doubt Utpaladeva's works also enjoyed a far greater influence. This Abhinavagupta suggests by speaking of them here as spreading in all directions. 

Since Kashmir is so small a valley – approximately 84 miles in length and 20 to 25 miles in breadth – I take Abhinavagupta to be asserting that these works by his teacher's teacher had already achieved fame far beyond Kashmir's mountain barriers. 

In the second verse, Abhinavagupta moves on to acknowledge Lakṣmaṇagupta, who was a disciple of Utpaladeva and the teacher with whom Abhinavagupta himself studied the Pratyabhijñā texts, as he tells us in his two commentaries on this literature. 

[COMPLETED] one from understanding it. 

The path taught by Somānanda and Utpaladēva was therefore a new **kaumāra** path. This is the term that Abhinavagupta uses. 

**Kaumāra**. New in the sense that it was not generally recognized, but also new in the sense that it was now being set forth in its entirety. But it should be understood that it was new only in a relative sense. 

As Abhinavagupta emphasizes, it was already present in all the esoteric scriptures – Sarvaraha**syaśāstrāntargata**san nigūḍhat**tvāt**. Concealed within all the esoteric scriptures. So it's there already. But concealed. Not fully manifest. Not easy to see.

So he goes on in the following verse, I'll just read that. **Saivātra prakāśitatvam paravādavidhvaṃsāt**, **śaṅkākalāṅkāpasarēṇa nītatva**. It is said to be placed in plain view, **prakāśitatvam**, by him – by him meaning Utpaladēva – that is freed from obscuration by the objections of the **paravāda**s, other schools of thought, by a series of investigations, **śaṅkā** – doubts, **kalāṅkā**, and their removal, **pasarēṇa**, that lead to the truth. 

So you have to be very sophisticated here, you see, in claiming that there's anything new because it is a **guruparamparā**, everything has to be traced back in an unbroken line, and this indeed is the very heart of the tradition. So you have to show that any innovations you introduce are not innovations at all, but a legitimate development of what's gone before. 

So, I'll stop there. 

[COMPLETED] way of the dawning of this liberating awareness. So it's very clear there that the function of philosophy is to facilitate enlightenment. The function is to to cut out at the root false views, leaving the field open to a direct intuition of the truth that remains. And it's clear also that he considers this method to be a _Kaula_ method. It's already there, it's in the _Kaula_ scriptures, but our exegetes have not brought it out. And now this is the brilliance of Somānanda, that he did put it in plain view. 

Yeah.

Now, as for Utpaladeva, we know of no work by him in any _Kaula_ tradition. But the doctrines of the _Kaula Krama_ shine through the devotional verses of his that were redacted as the _Śivastotrāvalī_ or sometimes called _Utpala Stotrāvalī_. This is a collection of hymns on which there is a commentary by Kṣemarāja because _Kṣema_ is _Śivasotrāvalī Vivṛti_. 

And it should be known, if not already known, by those who know something about Śaivism that this work is a compilation. It's not the work of Abhinava of Utpaladeva himself. There are one or two hymns which were complete hymns which were redacted into this collection, but it mostly consists of _muktakas_ – isolated verses which he composed for his daily worship, _āhnika_ verses, for his daily uh worship of Śiva. And uh two editors gathered them together and put them into verses, sometimes incoherently. And Kṣemarāja is fully aware of this and points it out from time to time that not don't don't blame me, blame Rāma and Āditya. They redacted the verses in this way. There are certain illogicalities of reason which the redactors didn't notice at the time. 

Nonetheless, the verses seem to be genuine. They are inspired by the same mentality throughout, and what we can see there is a very strong presence of the meditation tradition associated with the _Krama_. And I've given you some examples there. There are many more which are recognized by Kṣemarāja in his commentary. 

So:

> Adiṣṭa-yā-iva viṣayān imā karṇa-vṛttayā bhaktānāṁ preṣayanti tvat- pūjārthaṁ amṛtāsvam

So this is one of his devotional verses, _Śivasūtrāvalī_ 7.16. Um, which means simply, "By occupying their objects – Adiṣṭa-yā-iva viṣayān – these – imā karṇa-vṛttayā – these operations of our senses transmit to your devotees the wine of immortality with which to worship you." Simply by occupying their objects, the operations of the senses transmit to your devotees the wine of immortality for your worship. 

So um in his commentary, Kṣemarāja brings out the evident _Krama_ content of this statement as follows, using the term _Mahārta_ – the great teaching. This is his preferred name for the system. Uh in uh this is a feature characteristic of learned exegesis in India that everything has many names. And sometimes there's sense in them, sometimes there're not. You have to be on your guard. 

And um do we have a pen here? Thank you very much. Uh the _Krama_ is known variously as the _Mahārta_, which means the great teaching – _ārta_ here in the sense of a teaching – _Mahānaya_ – the great method, _Mahānaya_; _Devīnaya_ – the method of the Goddess; _Krama_ _Darśana_ – the _Krama_ doctrine; have I got them all? No, I'm sure I haven't. There are yet others. _Kāli Naya_ is also seen, the _Kāli_ system – _Kāli Naya_. All these are synonymous words. _Devatā Naya_ – the way of the deities, where the deities are the senses and the faculties of perception. 

So it has a number of names, and the one that Kṣemarāja prefers and uses most often is _Mahānaya_. It's also referred to as _Rahasya_ or _Parama Rahasya_ – the ultimately secret doctrine. 

You remember last week we saw Abhinavagupta in his in his _Gītārtha Saṅgraha_ claiming that this was the core teaching of the _Gītā_, the 11th chapter of the _Gītā_, when when Viṣṇu reveals his cosmic form to Arjuna? 

Yeah. 

So _Mahārta_ – the great teaching. And so this is his commentary:

> Imā karṇa-vṛttayo-pi cakṣur- ādi-devayo viṣayān rūpa- ādi-diṣṭa-yā-iva ākramya-iva śṛṣṭi-raktā-di- devatā-krameṇa bhaktānāṁ tvat- pūjārthaṁ antaḥ amṛtāsvādaṁ preṣayanti

"It is by engulfing visible forms and the other sense objects that these operations of the faculties – the goddesses that are the eyes and other means of sense perception – direct within for your devotees as the means of your worship the wine of the blissful state of liberation through the sequence of the arising of the 12 goddesses, of whom the first are Śṛṣṭi and Raktā." 

Actually, the editions say "Rukṣā", but the manuscripts confirm that it, when other arguments can demonstrate beyond doubt that it's the first two of the 12 _Kāli_s who are Śṛṣṭi-_kāli_ and Raktā-_kāli_ that he's referring to here. Um so he's referring here to the sequence of the 12 _kāli_s of the _Krama_'s phase of the nameless, the _Anākhyā Krama_, which, in the variant espoused by Abhinavagupta and Kṣemarāja, begins with Śṛṣṭi-_kāli_, followed by Raktā-_kāli_, and ends with the impressively named _Mahābhairavā Ghoracaṇḍogra Kāli_ – scary, terrifying, violent, etc. _kāli_. 

Such allusions are not rare in the hymns, leading Abhinavagupta to declare in his commentary – and I think you have this also on your handout – 

> _Mahārta-pūrṇa- āsyā-si- ā-sāropadeśa- varṣiṇī-imāni suktāni ulasanati

"Utpaladeva has fully internalized the _Mahārta_. He is _Mahārta-pūrṇa_. He's full of the _Mahārta_, full to bursting with the _Mahārta_. And so these elegant verses of his, these *imāni suktāni*, manifestly pour forth – *varṣiṇī* – the core teachings of that system." 

They flash forth – *ulasanati* – exuding, pouring forth – *varṣiṇī* – *_sāropa-* uh *_sāropadeśa_* – the core teachings, understand, of the _Mahārta_. 

And in his comment on _Śivastotrāvalī_ 83:

> _Mahārta- mudrā-mudritā- āsyā mudritāsya-iyaṁukti

"This is the utterance" – he's referring to the words of Utpaladeva – "This is the utterance of one who has been stamped with the seal of the _Mahārta_." 

So he's been pushed into that shape. He embodies the _Mahārta_. 

Similarly, referring to the 17th hymn, he says:

> Śrīman-_mahārta_-sāropadeśa-mayi- iyaṁ-utrastuti

"In that hymn that abounds in the core teachings of the venerable _Mahārta_."

So again and again, he's underlining this connection with the _Krama_. 

Um, so let's pause on that for a moment. Um, we're used to seeing, we tend to see this tradition through the eyes of Abhinavagupta largely, and particularly through the eyes of the _Tantrāloka_. And the _Tantrāloka_ is exegesis of a particular tantra of the _Trika_, the _Mālinīvijayottara_. He takes that as the basis for a comprehensive illumination of the tantras. And so we assume that the _Trika_ is at the center of everything uh in this tradition. 

But in fact, that doesn't seem to be the case. Abhinavagupta's emphasis on the _Trika_ is, I think, slightly marginal to the mainstream of this tradition. It seems that um Utpala, Ab- uh the young Abhinavagupta – and we talked about this last week – the young Abhinavagupta, the author of the _Gītārtha Saṅgraha_ and the _Kramastotra_ and Kṣemarāja represent the mainstream, which is that the that revelation is _vedādi-kramāntam_. It begins with the Vedas, which are the most universally valid uh apply to everyone, and ends with the _Krama_ uh which is only accessible to those ready for the _sāropadeśa_, so to speak. It's a kind of pyramidic structure. 

Not saying the Veda is invalid. Far from it! It's just that um its injunctions can be sublated or suspended on higher levels. So to give a banal example, _smṛti_ and _śruti_ declare that wine should not be consu- consumed. Alcoholic liquor should not be drunk – _Surā na peya_. But the _Sautrāmaṇi_ ritual in the in in uh the sh- it of _śruti_ teaches the consumption of of beer as an offering in which is prepared as an offering to Indra in the _Sautrāmaṇi_ sacrifice. 

And likewise, the Śaivas um the Śākta Śaivas uh justify the consumption of wine in ritual in the same way. These are special injunctions – _viśeṣa-vidhi_s – which uh contradict the generally valid injunctions of the Veda. Just as in grammar you have irregular verbs. You have general rules and you have special rules for exceptions. 

So if the _Sautrāmaṇi_ can be admitted as an exception in the vein in the domain of uh the Veda, then why not _Kaula_ worship? Unless, of course, you can show that it's motivated by greed or lust or whatever. And sometimes one feels that would be rather easy to do. If you real read the satires of Kṣemendra and others, you can see that, of course, as today, there were plenty of charlatans at work in the community, conning people whose main interest was getting – what of the unattractive men – getting access to women by claiming some kind of spiritual charisma. 

Um yeah, I won't dwell on that. It's uh I'm afraid a very conspicuous feature of the modern guru cults. Yeah. Not all of them, of course. Uh I don't want to say that everyone is a charlatan. Far from it! But charlatans abound. They abounded then, and no doubt they abound today. 

Um yes, so what about Lakṣmaṇagupta then? So it's highly probable that Lakṣmaṇagupta too was similarly engaged. And although he has been acknowledged directly by Abhinavagupta only as his guide in his study of the philosophical treatises of Utpaladeva, Jayaratha is clear that Lakṣmaṇagupta too was also an authority on the _Trika_. While explaining in the _Tantrāloka_ the order in which the mantras are to be installed in the non-_Kaula_ worship of the _Trika_, Abhinavagupta gives two interpretations of the scriptural passage that enjoins that practice. The first he attributes to Shambhunātha – we'll see him presently, not this week but later – the second he states without attribution. 

Jayaratha steps in in his commentary and tells us that this unattributed view is that of Lakṣmaṇagupta. One might suspect that the attribution is merely a guess. He's quite capable of guessing and filling in gaps, often wrongly. So it might be just a guess, and that Jayaratha may be may have reasoned that if a view on a technicality of the Trika reported by Abhinavagupta was not Śambhunātha's, then by default it had to be Lakṣmaṇagupta's. Since he was Abhinavagupta's guru in the Triambaka lineage, which, though most famousfor its philosophical works, he nonetheless saw as the domain of gurus of the Trika. 

But there is another place in the *Tantra-loka-vivēka*, Jayaratha's commentary on the *Tantra-loka*, that puts to rest this suspicion. For there Jayaratha reports Lakṣmaṇagupta's view on how a certain set of mantras should be formed, but on this occasion, he differentiates it not from the view of Śambhunātha, whom he does not mention in this context, but from that of unnamed earlier authorities, the ancients, *prācyāḥ*, predecessors. 

The matter in question is a tiresomely technical one, but I just mentioned it briefly so you can see the evidence. The matter in question is the correct form of the seed syllables of the five face-mantras of the root-mantra of Navātma-bhairava – there, you have it. Uh Abhinavagupta tells us, *vaktrāṇi yasya cakalpāyed akṣa-ya-ra-la-vālabījāistū dīptair bindu vibhūṣitaiḥ.* And here he's paraphrasing the *Mālinīvijayottara*. It means "and one should form the faces of this mantra with the seed syllables *kṣa ya ra la* and *va*, blazing, *dīptaih*, and adorned with the dot, the *anusvāra*."

So this is an abbreviation, a quotation, an abbreviated quotation-cum-paraphrase of *Mālinīvijayottara* 8.25-26. 

Now the divergence of opinion here concerns the interpre- the interpretation of the word *dīptaiḥ*, which means "on fire" or "blazing". Jayaratha reports that Lakṣmaṇagupta took this to mean that between each of the five consonants and its nasalized vowel, *kṣaṁ*, etc., one should insert *ra*. *ra* is the *Agni-bīja*, the consonant of fire. So when he says that they are blazing, this is a code for "add *ra* after the consonant." Uh it's perfectly common usage, in fact, in in Tantric texts to to use the word uh in that sense. 

Uh the view of the unnamed earlier authorities is that the word *dīptaiḥ* refers to the otherwise unmentioned vowels, which they say are inherently fiery or igneous – actually, a less convincing view – namely, those commonly employed for Śaiva face-mantras. 

I needn't go further into the details, but you you can see it all there. And there's even a rather elaborate note there, which I haven't deleted, um which uh takes up the crucial question of whether of why the um in the Mantrashastra the vowels *a i u e* and *o* are called short when *e* and *o* in Sanskrit are long vowels, prosodically long. But they're referred to as the five *hṛsva*s. And the view of Abhinavagupta is this is not *e o*, this is *ĕ ŏ*. And he cites the view of the uh the *Sāmavedī*s, two schools of the *Sāmaveda*, that have in their own pronunciation system precisely these short vowels. They're allophones of *a*, in fact. 

Um, if you want to follow the details, that's there in the footnote. You want to explore the explore these byways of the learned Shastric tradition um of the *Rāṇāyanīya*s and the *Śāṭyāmugrī*s and so forth. So um and also he notes – Abhinavagupta, with his usual broad learning, says – not only in the *Sāmavedī* chanting of these subsets of *Sāmavedī*s, but also in Middle Indic you have *ĕ* and *ŏ*. Quite right. We do. So so from now on when you cite those face-mantras, do not make them prosodically long. I'd actually assumed for a long time that they were short, but actually pronounced as long. And I've heard them pronounced as long, but now we must mend our ways and pronounce *ĕ* and *ŏ*, not *e o*. Yeah, *Śāṭyāmugrī* and *Rāṇāyanīya* schools of the *Sāmaveda*. Yeah, yeah, he's impressive sometimes. He comes up with really obscure pieces of information. And you find yourself scratching your head and uh rummaging around and finding out what the *Śāṭyāmugrī*s thought about the pronunciation of *ĕ* and *ŏ*. It's not – you won't get it on Google, not easily anyway. 

Um, right. Yes. Yeah.

Now, this leaves the question as to whether Jayaratha considered Lakṣmaṇadupta's authority to be confined outside the *Pratyabhijñā* to the Tantra system of the Trika. Remember there are two levels of Abhinavagupta's Trika: a Tantra-prakriyā um and a Kaula-prakriyā. Uh I haven't said enough about what what makes a *Tantra-prakriyā* a *Tantra-prakriyā*, I think. Um but simply, the *Tantra-prakriyā* uh is something which is shared by all the Tantric cults. They all follow the same model basically, the same ritual procedures. What changes are variables, such as the *mantra*-seed, the seed syllables, the *mudrā*s, the *maṇḍala*s, the uh the the the software remains the same, as it were. You just change certain variables. Hm? And um in this respect the *Tantra-prakriyā* of the *Mālinīvijayottara* is just like the *Tantra-prakriyā* of a Śaidan̈tika Tantra or the *Svacchanda*, or indeed of a Vaiṣṇava text, such as the *Pāñcarātrika* scriptures. Hm? They're all following basically the same, using the same software, if I may use that analogy. It's just that the data input is somewhat different. Um so we could design a computer program which would generate us any number of *Tantra-prakriyā*s, if you like, for the worship of any deity. We just have to specify the seed syllables and so forth. And don't worry, we wouldn't have to invent new *mudrā*s each time. We could use old ones. It's not that difficult. It's quite within the range of possibility. 

Um so that's what we mean by *Tantra-prakriyā*, whereas the *Kaula-prakriyā*, the Kaula system, comes from a very different source. Seen from the *Tantra-prakriyā*, you could say it's a condensation of the *Tantra-prakriyā*. All kinds of uh features seen as unnecessary elaborations are stripped away. Um it – the emphasis upon direct experience, sensation, and so forth. Um removing elaboration and getting down to core essentials. But you can't understand the *Tantra-* you can't understand the *Kaula-prakriyā* simply as a simplification of the *Tantra-prakriyā*. It has certain unique features which come from a prehistory which has nothing to do with the *Tantra-prakriyā*. And that prehistory is that of the Kāpālika tradition with its big emphasis upon sexuality and possession. Orgiastic worship. Collective worship, orgiastic worship, and possession, which have no antecedents in the *Tantra-prakriyā*, except in the *Atimārga* phase that precedes the Tantric developments, on the far left of that tradition that we see in the *Saumasiddhānta* of the Kāpālikas. Okay? So it's not enough just to say that the *Kaula-prakriyā* is a simplified version of the *Tantra-prakriyā*. It has very different features. Uh particularly, I I can stress possession. 

Um when you uh are accepted for initiation in the Kashmirian tradition, um you have to be patient for six days. It takes six days to take you through the entire procedure. And the guru has an extra day at the end. He has a seventh day of worship to observe, but doesn't concern the initiates. They they can go home at that point. So it's a very elaborate procedure, and you need a lot of patience, but you don't need empathy. You just gotta sit there quietly while it's all done for you. No personal experience is obligatory. But in the Kaula system, you have to go into a possession trance. Not everyone is good at that. And so, and so and so, um the text says you put the person into this uh *āveśa*, state of possession. If they fail to get into it, you have a more vigorous method to adopt. There are various other methods to push the person into a possession trance, and if that doesn't work, *upalavajjyed*, he should cast them aside like a stone. It's like, you're trying to hypnotize someone. Some people can't be hypnotized. Yeah, so some people can't be possessed by the goddess. But once you're in this possession state, then you're supposed to actually perform the acts of initiation to yourself, with your own limbs, but the the idea is *you're* not doing it, the goddess is doing it through your body. She's taken over your body. So it's a very different world that they're living in. It parallels many of the rites that are being done in the *Tantra-prakriyā*, but in a state of possession. So it's really quite different.

So so far, the only evidence of um Lakṣmaṇagupta's involvement in practice outside the philosophical corpus is with reference to the *Tantra-prakriyā* of the Trika as laid out in the *Mālinīvijayottara*. He's only cited on two points pertaining to that. 

So what about the *Kaula-prakriyā*? Well, the presu- the assumption is, and it's a reasonable assumption, is that the *Tantra-prakriyā* doesn't come on its own without the *Kaula-prakriyā*, that this system is rooted in the *Kaula-prakriyā*, in the Kaula system. So, it's very unlikely that he'd be an expert simply in the *Tantra-prakriyā* without any experience of the *Kaula-prakriyā*. Um but, and I I know of no uh explicit evidence that Lakṣmaṇagupta um uh – he's never cited on a point of pertaining to the Kaula worship. 

However, Jayaratha at some point in his commentary on the *Tantra-loka* um asserts that Abhinavagupta's teachers in the understanding of the *Devīpañcaśatikā*, which is one of the two root texts of the Krama following in Kashmir, were the same as those from whom he received the Trika, namely, Somānanda and Utpaladeva. So, he actually uh Jayaratha makes this assertion at least. But you could just – you could say that that just amounts to his assuming that Lakṣmaṇagupta would've been just like his teachers, but I think it's a fairly reasonable assumption to make. 

Um so we have a lacuna in our evidence there. We can't say very much about Lakṣmaṇagupta. He's left no works behind. But I think it's reasonable to to make the point that this lineage, although noted for its philosophical reasoning, um is nonetheless a practice tradition. You couldn't be one without the other. Hm? You couldn't just be a logic-chopper without actually being involved in meditative practice and ritual practice indeed. 

So now, [COMPLETED] I had thought I might go on um to cover the next verse, but actually the timing is is great. It's exactly 5:00, and uh we can stop there. 

Yeah, thank you very much.
