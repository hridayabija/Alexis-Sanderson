## Deciphering the Trika in Early Kashmir: A Deep Dive into Esoteric Traditions

Welcome everybody to the final lecture by Professor Sanderson on the *Tantra Loka*. Well, a final lecture for us, uh, for this term. I'm not moribund. Quite. And uh, um, so he'll be concluding his, uh, his, his, uh, this, uh, his discussion of the, um, the opening verses of the *Tantra Loka*, so I'll exit the scene. Thank you.

Well, last week, uh, we read the 13th of the introductory verses in which Abhinavagupta acknowledges his debt to Shambhunātha, his Guru Shambhunātha, and that Guru's consort Bhagavatī, his female consort Bhagavatī. And I presented evidence that this lineage going back through Shambhunātha, um, derives from the Deccan. That is not an indigenous Kashmirian lineage, which is a useful reminder of the, uh, the error of assuming that because most texts arise from a certain region they *all* arise from that region. That somehow you've regionalized the tradition and you can talk about Kashmir Shaivism as though it were a self-contained element. 

In my view, as you probably know, to refer to Shaivism of Kashmir as Kashmir Shaivism is about as illusory, is about as wrong as to refer to Catholicism as Polish Catholicism just because there are many Catholics in Poland and no doubt there've been some distinguished Polish theologians. It doesn't become thereby a Polish phenomenon. Um, so likewise, likewise here. 

So we had this lineage, an unnamed Guru presiding in the *dakṣiṇāpatha*, the *dakṣiṇā bhūmipīṭha*, which I didn't have time to go into, but I actually identify in all probability with Kolhāpur, Kolāgiri as it was called in earlier times, uh, which is in the far south of Mahārāshtra quite close to the border of the modern state of Karnātaka, and for centuries has been a major center of goddess worship. That's where the temple of Mahālakṣmī is located. That's a pretty, uh, tame enterprise these days. It's very smarṭized, um, de-tantricized in its in its character. But we know from earlier times it was a much more typical *śākta pīṭha* in earlier centuries, uh, with a specialization in devotional self-mutilation among other things. A king tried to avert a plague by chopping off one of his fingers and giving it to the goddess. We have inscriptional evidence of this; it's recorded by the king himself. I don't know whether it worked. I do hope so. 

Um, so we have this tradition coming in from the Deccan, or rather, rather we should say we don't have evidence that the *Trika* came in from the Deccan. From that alone we have other evidence which suggests that. But now this week I want to end my treatment of the 13th verse by asking the question: what do we know about the *Trika* in Kashmir *before* Abhinavagupta, which is our main source of knowledge of the *Trika* in Kashmir? 

Um, now, Abhinavagupta's dates are are not established beyond doubt, but we have some dates for some of his works and these stretch from the nineteen the nine nineties through to tenth thou- to to 1050. So we can say he's roughly around a thousand AD is the center of his of his life's work. So how much before that can we take the *Trika* as present in Kashmir? And my answer is that we can take it back to the first quarter of the 9th century, which is actually two centuries earlier than the detailed evidence we have from *Tantrāloka*. 

Now, there are no learned Shaiva texts surviving from Kashmir from that period. Um, the earliest works we have are works like the *Spandakārikā* and, um, you know, *Śivasūtras* and commentaries on those, which really perhaps emerged in the 9th century, um, but the exegesis is subsequent and roughly contemporary with Abhinavagupta. Um, we know also that the *Krama*, the system of Kāli worship, uh, esoteric Kāli worship, um, was present, was growing in the in the in the region again from the middle of the 9th century, um, beyond, uh, after the Karkoṭa dynasty in Kashmir. There was a kind of upsurge of of, uh, Shaiva esotericism in the valley which brought to the fore the *Spandakārikā*, the *Śivasūtras*, and the *Krama*. But no evidence of the *Trika* at that stage. If you look at the *Spandakārikā* and the *Śivasūtras*, um, there's nothing there which reveals beyond doubt that the redactor of that text was aware of the *Trika* as a system of ritual with a particular pantheon, particular *mantras*, particular *maṇḍalas*, for example, which, uh, is those sorts of things which are the signature of a tradition. Hmm. 

There's no point talking about, "Oh, well there's traces of non-dualism" or whatever. That's not enough. You need concrete evidence of knowledge of specific *mantras*, specific *maṇḍalas*, and if you can if you have that you can also look for other things, uh, esoteric information which is a signature of a particular tradition. You can look for signs of that. 

### Early Evidence of the Trika in the Haravijaya

So where have I found this, uh, very early evidence, relatively early evidence of the *Trika*? Well, it's in the *Haravijaya*. Um, the *Haravijaya Mahākāvya*. It really deserves the title the title *Mahā Kāvya*. It's the longest of our surviving *kāvyas*. It's five and a half thousand verses approximately, which is actually a massive accomplishment because each of these verses is a is a Himalaya to climb. I mean, they're not easy. They're very complex and subtle compositions, and you've got 5,000 of them, um, all, uh, relating a mythological event, namely the slaying and liberation thereby of the Titan - some people would say demon, that's incorrect, Titan - Aṇḍaka, one of the *asuras* who was killed in in Shaiva mythology. Uh, in this case by Chaṇḍī, the goddess Chaṇḍī, the ferocious goddess Chaṇḍī. She finally skewers him on her trident, um, he, um, is consumed, his blood boils on the trident, and he's finally reduced to ashes, and then a light emerges from the ashes and is seen by the amazed onlookers merging into the body of the goddess. 

And this trope of liberation through absorption of light from the ashes into the into the into the heart of the deity, uh, which clearly symbolizes liberation, is actually drawn by, uh, Raṭnākara from Māgha, the great 7th century poet Māgha, who ends his *Śiśupālavadha* in exactly the same way. The final verse is being reflected by Raṭnākara, in fact, in his *Haravijaya*. Again, the same mode motif of the, um, the slaying of Śiśupāla and the exiting of his spiritual essence in the form of a light, a bright light, and disappearing into the body of Viṣṇu in this case, not Chaṇḍī. 

So, um, in this huge work, um, there are two hymns forming the sixth and 47th cantos or chapters, um, and it's the second of these, the 47th chapter in 177 verses, that is the object of the source of this information I'm about to give you. This is a hymn to the goddess Chaṇḍī on the eve of her final destruction and liberation, libera- ting of the Titan Aṇḍaka. And the poet has adopted a very, uh, interesting, uh, approach which is to adore the goddess in a number of different ways. Um, some of them quite familiar, uh, reference to her mythological exploits. Quite a lot of that. Description of her gruesome temple in the Vindhya mountains and so forth, in which actually he relies upon an earlier *purāṇa kāvya*, uh, the *Gauḍavaho* of, uh, Vākpati. 

Um, but in addition to the the *paurāṇika* references we have a lot of esoteric material in which the motif is that the goddess is praised as the absolute of all the current mythologi- all the current metaphysical systems or soteriological systems current in the Kashmir of that period. So we get a fascinating tour of of current soteriologies in Kashmir at that time. And there's clearly an attempt on his part to be comprehensive. The only, um, system which you would see the almost complete lack of is Jainism. And there are plenty of other reasons, plenty there's plenty of other evidence to support the conclusion that Jainism was absent or just marginal in Kashmir. It never really took root in Kashmir. There's a certain amount of satire of Jains, but you know, the Jains are really set up for that purpose. You know, they're they're accused of being dirty and you know, this this, you know, because they don't wash. There's a there're really asking for it. 

So there's a certain amount of satire, for example, in the *Āgamaḍambara* of Jayanta Bhaṭṭa, a Kashmirian work, um, where there's a nice scene in the drama in in which, uh, a clearly corrupt muni is chasing a female ascetic. You know, that this is, you know, sort of standard, um, substance or matter of of subject matter of satire. 

Um, but otherwise, all the other systems are are are being covered. Uh, Brahmanical and Buddhist. Particularly the Buddhist systems are given very generous and insightful treatment. Um, it's clear that, uh, a learned Kashmiri at that time did not have a mere superficial book knowledge of the Buddhist traditions. They were thoroughly educated in them. And we're looking at a culture at this time in which Buddhism in which, um, Brahmanism and and, uh, uh, Buddhism are essentially on equal terms. And, um, in fact Brahmanical kings, although presenting themselves as essentially Brahmanical, principally Brahmanical, offered very generous, uh, patronage of Buddhism. 

Now, in the Brahmanical camp we find, um, a certain amount of, uh, *śākta* material. And when we look at the detail of that *śākta* material, I see the *Trika* in a very specific way, not at simply, "Oh well, here here the goddess is being identified as the innate power of a non-dual reality, so it *must* be the *Trika*." No, that doesn't follow. We see here in the verses that you have in front of you on item one, um, a series of verses, uh, four out of six that I found in in this work, which seem to me to be, um, clearly, uh, uh, clear evidence of not merely awareness of the *Trika*, but of a detailed knowledge of its esoteric, uh, subject matter. And I would go further and say that it reveals not merely that the author was aware of these matters, that he happened to be an initiate perhaps in the *Trika*. Uh, it it it it it it I think is the basis for inference that his audience likewise was thoroughly acquainted with these details. Because if there's if there's one thing guaranteed to make your poetry fall flat on its face is an audience which has no idea what you're talking about. 

### The Importance of Accuracy in Alamkara Shastra

And generally speaking, it's a principle in Alamkara Shastra that you get your facts right and you don't invent religious systems that don't exist or distort them by getting the details wrong. You do your research before embedding the stuff in poetry. It's often been the case in Indology that authors have, when encountering, um, evidence in literary works that doesn't fit their preconception about sects, particular religious traditions, say, "Oh well, this person is writing out of a hatred of Vaishnavism or hatred of Shaivism or whatever. They don't know what they're talking about." In my experience, generally, authors who do, uh, venture to attack other systems *do* know what they're talking about. They may put an odd spin on it from time to time, a prejudiced view, but nonetheless, they get their facts right. And this is true in Kashmir as well. A work like the Malati Madhava, the drama, Malati Madhava, seems to me to have a very intimate understanding of Kapalika practice and assumes in the audience - they're going to pick up these detailed references. 

So I think we can see from such materials that there really was, um, in the audience of such literature, um, a considerable acquaintance, a substantial acquaintance with these esoteric traditions. 

### Dating the Material: The Reign of Chip pata Jayapada

Now, just briefly on the date of this material, just so we can see how much earlier it is. Um, unfortunately our Kashmirian historian Kalhana in his *Rājatarangiṇī* has no proper dates, no really reliable dates until, um, uh, late in the 9th century with the the death of, uh, um, King Avantivarman. That's the first time he gives a precise state with day, month, and year. Previously, the chronology is rather vague, but he does, um, introduce a an exact year for the first time in his history, um, in 1813, which he says is the day on which the, um, king ruling at the time of the Maha the, uh, *Haravijaya*, um, was killed by his uncles. This is a young boy king who ruled nominally for 12 years. He was called Chip pata Jayapada. Jayapada the snub-nosed. For some reason he had this derogatory, uh, uh, epithet attached to him. 

So, snub-nosed, um, uh, Jayapada, uh, ruled for 12 years before being killed by his, uh, uh, uncles who were afraid that once he became an adult, he would turn on them because they've been exploiting him ruthlessly for 12 years. Um, so they decided the best thing to do would be to get rid of him. And he gives us the year in the Laukika era, saying that it's the 89th year. Now, Laukika era dates are a nightmare because they always leave out the first two digits. It's like when I was, uh, in the last century, when I was born, I was born in '48. Of course, 1948, but you leave out the first two so that we we But we can tell from other synchronicities that the year, in fact, is 3889, which is 830 to 840. Now, we know from other evidence that this is slightly inaccurate. 

We need to evidence in the in the in the *Tangshu*, the official, uh, annals of the Tang Dynasty, recording various diplomatic contacts. We know from this and also from a couple of other, um, synchronicities that that probably we should add 25 years or thereabouts to these dates. He's got it slightly wrong. So, this, um, tells us, um, that he was murdered, uh, and ruled rather he ruled and was murdered, ruled from 826 and was murdered in 838. So, this young king, who was the patron of our poet, uh, ruled during those years. 

### Analyzing the Verses: Unraveling the Esoteric Language

Now, the verses themselves. 

**Item 1: *Haravijaya* 47.13cd-14**

> *jyotirmayīṃ akaraṇendriyavṛttim ādyāṃ haṃsākṣarasthitimayīṃ viśṛtāmṛtaughaṃ*
>
> *śrīkaṇṭamukhyaguruṣoḍaśavīramūrtim utphullaśaktikamalāsanatāmupetām*
>
> *śaktitrayapratiṭaśūlakarāṃ śivāyā dhamanā jaganti sakalānyavabhāsayantīṃ*
>
> *kalolasaṃkulaparāmṛtasaṃpadamtvaṃ jāyantī bhairavataṃ kila kaulikāstāḥ* 

Uh, understand all this is qualifying Caṇḍīṃ, but in the accusative. The goddess Caṇḍī. Um, very elegantly, smoothly, smoothly composed. Uh, I think he's a great poet. He's underestimated by historians of poetry, and there's a reason for that. The work is just so intimidating. It's so huge. To get your mind around it is really a bit of a challenge. And we're lucky it survived into the present. Very few manuscripts survive of the work. There's a reason for that too. 

Um, so we have to take those two words as a *kulaka*, those two verses as a *kulaka*, as a combination of two verses. Um, *kila*. *Kila āgame kila prasiddhau*. *Kila* expresses common knowledge. We all know that. It is commonly known or the scriptures revealed to us because it has both of those meanings. According to tradition, according to common knowledge, *kila*. 

**Translation:**

> *kaulikāstāḥ* - Those whose faith or conviction is in the *Kaulikam*. That means the revelation of the *Kula*. This Kaula system, the Shakta system, at the heart of the later *Trika* I've been talking about. 
>
> *jāyantī tvāṃ* - They meditate upon you. *Tvāṃ jāyantī* as *bhairavatanum*, in your Bhairava aspect, having a Bhairava body. That's to say as Bhairavī. They meditate they meditate upon you as Bhairavī. *Tanu* often has the sense of *ātmā* rather than *śarīram*. Hm.
>
> *jyotirmayīm* - You who embody pure light, pure radiance. *Jyotirmaya*. They meditate upon you as radiance, the pure radiance of consciousness, in other words. Jo- *Jyotirmayam*. 
>
> *akaraṇendriyavṛtim* - Free, literally, not having the *vṛtti*, but free of the activity of the *karana* and *indriya*, by transcending the operation of the mind. This is what *karana* means here. It stands for *antaḥkaraṇa*, the internal organ, the mind *and* the sense faculties, *indriya*. So, they meditate upon you as the pure light that transcends the operations of the mind and the senses, pure light of consciousness. 
>
> *ādyāṃ haṃsākṣarasthitimayīm* - Embodying, *mayīm*, the presence, *sthiti*, of the *haṃsākṣara*. Now we're going into esoterica. The the the *haṃsa* sound or phoneme. And that is h. Hm. Ha. I shouldn't say 'h' but you know what I mean. Ha. It's the syllable 'ha', or, if you like, the consonant, unpronounceable because I didn't give you a vowel. Um.
>
> *viśṛtāmṛtaugham* - From whom, or by whom, from whom a flood of nectar flows forth. *Viśṛtāmṛtaugham*. And the nectar is a code word in the *Mantraśāstra* of this tradition for the letter 's'. Nectar, the nectar sound, *amṛtabīja*, is 's'. So we now have 'h' and 's'. *Ha sa*. 
>
> *śrīkaṇṭamukhyaguruṣoḍaśavīramūrtim* - Who embodies the hero, *vīra*. *Vīra* is a term for, uh, Rudras in this Shakta literature. Who is the 16th of the gurus of whom the first, *mukhya*, is Śrīkaṇṭha. Now, this is very obscure stuff if you don't know if you're not familiar with the *Trika*. This is really obscure and indeed meaningless to one, you know? So you need to know that the 16, uh, Rudras, beginning with Śrīkaṇṭha, are the Rudras who personify the 16 vowels from 'a' through to *visarga*. Hm. That makes 16. Hm? Because we have *aṃ* and *aḥ* as the 15th and 16th in this conventional, uh, analysis of the of the of the alphabet. So that gives us the final sound, who gives us the sound *visarga*. Hm. 
>
> *utphullaśaktikamalāsanatāmupetām* - Literally who has gone to, *upetām*, who has become. You know how in Sanskrit you can say "has gone to X-ness", meaning has become X. Hm. *Pañcatvaṃ gataḥ*. He has gone to five-ness. He's he's only five - the five elements. The soul has left. So here, he has gone to *kamalāsanatām*. Being the lo- She has gone to being the lotus throne. *Kamalāsana tām upetām*. She has be- Who is, has as her rather, sorry. It's Bhairavī. Has gone to the state of having as her lotus throne, *kamalāsanatām utphullaśakti*. *Śakti* expanded to its fullest, *utphulla*. This is a metaphor from flowers, which open. So, a fully open flower is *utpala*, *utpala* rather, or pra- *utpala*. So here, *śakti* is at its greatest extent. And what is that? *Au*. The last of the vowels before *aṃ* and *aḥ* is identified in the *Trika* system as the the nature of *au*, the the letter *au* in the unfolding of the alphabet. So, what do we have now? We have *ha sau au*. We have a *bīja*, uh, *ha sau au*. I'll come back to that because that's this takes us into the *Trika*. Um.
>
> *śaktitrayapratiṭaśūlakarāṃ śivāyā* - Um, who has in her hand, *karām*, the trident, *śūla*, *pratiṭa*, manifested, *Śaktitraya*, by the three *śaktis*: *parā*, *parāpara*, *aparāpara*, or *icchā*, *jñāna*, and *kriyā*, to revert to information we've had earlier in these lectures. 
>
> *dhamanā jaganti sakalānyavabhāsayantīm* - Causing to appear, understand in consciousness. *Avabhāsayantīm*, causing to appear all the worlds. Hm. *Jaganti sakalāni*. You can say the universe. Causing the universe to appear in consciousness, *dhamanā*, through her radiance, *dhamanā*. So, the radiance of consciousness *is* the appearance of the world in consciousness. 

So you can see that not only is this author familiar with details of the *Trika*, he also already seems to have the *rasa* of the *Trika* as we find it in the works of Abhinavagupta. Don't you feel the same *rasa* there? The same sentiment somehow. Um.

**Item 2: *Haravijaya* 47.15**

> *Janayaṃ paraṃ pāpaviddhivṛtaṃ janayaṃ vayam kaulikā janayaṃ śaktipatitāmiti sthirabhairavāṅkavṛtim.*

Um, manifested, um, ja, um, *para papa viddhivati janayam janayam*. We, because actually the speakers are plural. They are the Siddhas are Diaz, the audience of this hymn. They are they are rather uttering this hymn to the goddess. And *janayam*. It's an interesting idiom in Sanskrit. It means "I, ahem", or if you like, "we", if it's plural in the context. But it suggests, um, an apologetic withdrawal, you know, "your humble servant", so to speak. *Janayam*. Like, uh, I I believe the expression "son of God" in Aramaic, something which many volumes of theology have been produced, actually is an Aramaic idiom of polite self-reference. "I am mere son of man". So like was *janayam*. This person here is a modest way of self-reference. 

So we Kaulas, Kaulikas. *Janayam*. These we, these Kaulas. So the audience are declaring themselves to be Kaulas. The Siddhas, ideas are revealing themselves to be initiates in the Kaula tradition, which is somewhat interesting observation. We, uh, we, we Kaulas, your devotees as it were. Um, um. Yeah, I've written it like this in my translation. 

**Translation:**

> Here we Kaulas, your humble devotees.

*Kauliko kaulikaha ja noyam*. Achieve the state of Lordship of the wheel of powers, *śaktipatitam*. *Iti śaktipatitam*, go to the state of being *śaktipati*, the Lord of powers. So this is the expression, uh, we find in the in the *Shiva Sutras*, um, *chakraswara* being the Lord of the circle of powers. So we become the Lord of powers. We enter into that state of being the *śaktipati*. 

**Translation:**

> We Kaulas, your humble devotees, achieve the state of being **śaktipātītā**, which is in the very heart of the stable reality of **Bhairava**, 

*Stira Byrava Anka Vriti*, whose mode of operation, whose *Vriti*, whose dynamism rests in the heart of stable Byrava. *Stira Byrava Anka*, literally "in the lap", but it means obviously not the physical lap, but the the heart, the core of Byrava, unchanging Byrava. So Byrava is a kind of unchanging substrate, the screen on which the show of *śakti* appears. Kundalini's nature is. 

**Translation:**

> …whose mode of operation, whose *Vriti*, whose dynamism rests in the heart of stable Byrava. 

*Parāparavibhedavātim*, this mode of operation, this dynamism dynamism, which has a distinction, which contains a distinction between the transcendent and the immanent, *parāparavibhedavātim*. So it's not purely a transcendent inner higher reality, it also has a higher manifestation than the higher, which is its presence in the manifest universe. 

So, from this, uh, *Śaiva* point of view, the *Śākta-Śaiva* point of view, one rises from above to below. One ascends, as it were, from the state of inner self-realization to a greater state of self-realization in the ordinary movement of the senses and the mind. 

So this state of, uh, *śaktipātītā* is one that is not diluted by coming out of *samādhi*, so to speak. You don't think, "Okay, well, that was over. Now I'll meditate again in a couple of hours' time, and again taste that bliss of immersion in my inner nature." No, no, you have to take that inner nature and experience it in everyday experience. That's the that's what distinguishes this rather aesthetically oriented notion of liberated consciousness. 

Now, what is the practice? What is to be meditated upon? That's stated in the first half of the verse. Sound like a school teacher, excuse me. Um. 

**Translation:**

> Having meditated upon you, 

*cakrāśritātriśikākoṭigatāravinda-satkarṇikāsanagatāṃ tvām.* Meditate, having meditated upon you *gatāṃ*, located on, just on *gatāṃ*, the throne, *āsana*, the seat, which is the beautiful pericarp or seed pod, *satkarṇikā*, of the lotuses, *āravinda*, which are upon *gati*, the *triśikākoṭi*, the tips of the trident, *triśikākoṭigatāravindasatkarṇikāsanagatāṃ* in your *maṇḍala*, *cakrāśritā*. *Cakra* here means *maṇḍala*. 

So you remember from an earlier lecture, I showed you a picture of the *Trika-maṇḍala*, which features a trident at the center with lotuses on each of the three, uh, tips of those tridents, and the goddess installed in her aspects as *parāparā*, *parā*, and *aparā* on those three. With the higher notion that *parā* has two aspects, as it were. One as one of the three, and another as the source of the three. A higher, a *parāparāvibhedavṛtti*, if you like, again. Um, and in that higher nature she is known as *Mātrisadbhavā*, the essence of all knowers, and also as *Kālasaṃkarṣiṇī*, the obliterator of time, which is the more *krama* oriented name. 

So here we see again a clear reference to the *maṇḍala* of the of the of the *Trika*. The most common *maṇḍala* of the *Trika*, the trident. The *Triśūlābjamaṇḍala*, the *maṇḍala* of the trident and the lotuses. One trident, three lotuses, or four, in the case of the variant of the *Devīyāgamala*, the the *krama* inflected variant. 

So I think I've I've I've shown you enough to indicate that the author was fully conversant with the esoteric particulars of this tradition, already in this early period, in the early 9th century. And also that his audience must presumably have been sufficiently clued in not to be utterly lost by these, uh, unintelligible details. 

### Delving into the Particulars of the Trika Tradition

Now, can we go further and say something about the particulars of this *Trika* tradition? Because, you know, it's always there's a terrible tendency in Indology to to avoid differentiation. Perhaps everyone's influenced by *Advaita Vedānta* in some way - they want to be everything the same. So, okay, we made a distinction now between *krama* and *Trika*, that's enough, isn't it? Do we have to go into further subdivisions? Can't we just leave it there? Um, no, we should go into further subdivisions. What happens when a system is referred to, is given a name, is that various slightly discrepant systems are as it were gathered in together and labeled under a collective term. 

So when we look inside this bag, which is the *Trika*, we see quite distinct traditions. Last week, we saw a very distinct form of the *Trika*, as taught in the *Tantrasadbhāvatantra*, where meditation is focused upon Bhairava and the goddess in *Ardhanārīśvara* form, as a single body, half female, half male. No trace of that in Abhinavagupta's *Trika*. I pointed this out last time. Um, we've also seen, uh, in the course of these lectures, um, a differentiation between a form of the *Trika* found in the *Mālinīvijayottara*, which is the root of the *Tantrāloka*, which venerates the three goddesses on the trident, and a form taught in the *Devīyāgamala*, a lost *tantra* with a strong *krama* orientation, which teaches a transcendent fourth goddess, *Kālasaṃkarṣiṇī*. We have two traditions there already. 

#### The Significance of the Triśirobhairava

Now we have a third, that of the *Triśirobhairava*. The *Triśirobhairava*, I'll just put up the name. The *tantra* of the three-headed Bhairava. 

Now, there's a tradition in Kashmir, which is alive at least into the 13th century, that the scriptures of the *Trika* are divided into three main works, uh, three core scriptures. The first is the *Siddhayogeśvarīmata*, of which we have a small recension surviving in Nepal, which is ritualistic. It really is concerned with *sādhana*, incantation, rounds to produce supernatural effects for the most part. It's not really oriented to liberation strongly I would say. Um, then we have the *Triśirobhairava*. It's mentioned as one of the three cardinal scriptures. And the *Triśirobhairava*, which does not survive - at least no manuscripts have come to light - um, is said by Jayaratha to be *jñāna pradānam*, to be a gnostic text as opposed to a ritualistic text. And this ritualism, this non-ritualism, this gnosticism, this knowledge orientation is borne out by the many citations that we have in Jayaratha's commentary on *Tantrāloka*, and in Abhinavagupta's references to the text in *Tantrāloka* itself. It's extremely obscure, extremely esoteric. Um, talking about things we can't see, um, often to do with esoteric meditation on centers in the body, using a very obscure terminology, which we just don't fully understand. And I suspect Abhinavagupta didn't either. 

Um, this is the problem with a scriptural tradition. You know, knowledge comes and goes. It's a vast, diverse corpus. Even a brain like Abhinavagupta's was unable to access full information about everything *śāmbhava* within his purview. So what does he do in those cases? Well, he doesn't say *na jānami*. It's not part of the convention of omniscience to admit you don't know. So, he says "No, *atirahasya tvād etaṃ na vyākhyeyam*". I mustn't explain this because it's too secret. Sometimes there are empty boxes. Um, that *rahasya* can mean indeed something which you don't want to talk about publicly. Um, your private life, for example, is something that has some in a sense. It exists, but is but is but is secret in a way. Um, and so also in esoteric matters, there can be practices which you don't want to talk about openly for fear of being misunderstood. But sometimes the word *rahasya* really I think just covers a gap in information. And this is very much true with comments about the *Triśirobhairava*. 

Now why am I mentioning the *Triśirobhairava* here in association with these verses? Well, because the syllable *hasau* that we saw, um, subtly raised in that verse, letter by letter, is a form of the seed syllable of the goddess Parā, as taught in the *Triśirobhairava* and nowhere else. And well, I can put it perhaps more accurately by saying in the *Mālinīvijayottara*, the *Siddhayogeśvarīmata*, and the *Tantrasadbhāva*, the syllable of the goddess is *sau*. In the *Triśirobhairava*, we have a different tradition, *hasau* or *sahau*. The the first two can be either way around. Um, and I've seen no evidence of its, uh, in the literature of it having this form except in the *Triśirobhairava*. 

So it looks as if we have the *Triśirobhairava* ruling the roost in Kashmir in this early period rather than the tradition of the *Mālinīvijayottara* or the *Siddhayogeśvarīmata*. Um, I think on your handout you'll have a fair amount of material to back that up. Um, I threwthis together rather quickly, and without without weeding out quite a few of the footnotes. Which as you can see are rather detailed. Um, my idea is to try to explain everything, but not to burden over-burden the reader, who doesn't want to look into the minute details. But if they have their doubts, they can read the footnotes and see what evidence I think supports my interpretation. 

**Item 3: *Tantrāloka* 30.152cd-153ab**

> *Sāneka-bhedātriśiraśāstre proktāmaheśvarasvarūpataḥ*
>
> *avibhinnapy racanāneka-saṃkulā jīvaprāṇasthā evātra prāṇovā jīvasaṃsthitāḥ*

So for example, on *jñānam*, there's a long section there citing various *Ālaṃkāraśāstra* works and so forth, um, *kāvya* works. But if you look at your item on, uh, item two on page four of the hand- handout, you will see a citation from *Tantrāloka*, the 30th book of *Tantrāloka*, which deals with the *mantras* of the *Trika*, on *hasau*. Um, and I'm saying that this is a signature of the *Trika*, the *Triśirobhairava*. 

**Translation:**

> *Parā*, that 'sa', has been taught by Maheśvara in the *Triśirobhairava* to have more than one form or type. Although undifferentiated in her essence, *svarūpataḥ avibhinnapi*, she is replete with diverse forms. Among these, the living soul may rest on the vital breath. Living soul is code for 'sa', letter 'sa', and the vital breath is code for 'ha'. Or the vital breath on the soul, so it can be *hasau* or *sahau*. Not *shau*, by the way, perhaps I should put a hyphen there, to to to remove that confusion.

And Jayaratha in the item three that follows on page five explains this.  

**Item 4: *Tantrāloka* 30.153ab: *Jayaratha*'s commentary**

> *Tad uktaṃ tatra*:
>
> *Parāśaktis tu sāvitryā icchayā ca niyojitā*
>
> *jīvaprāṇasthā evātra prāṇovā jīvasaṃsthitāḥ*
>
> *iti*. *tena shasau hasau veti*.  That's Jayaratha's commentary.

**Translation:**

> That matter has been taught in that text, the *Triśirobhairava*, as follows: 
>
> "Here the *śakti* *Parā* is the living soul 's', on the vital breath 'h', or *vice versa*, conjoined with Sāvitrī. That's code for *au*, and the pre-cognitive impulse." That's *visarga*. So it is *harsau*. So rather than this, it is *sahau* or *harsau*.

Um, now interestingly *harsau* is also the form of Parā's seed syllable that has reached us in the ritual manuals of the Śaiva officiants of Kashmir. These largely anonymous materials, but not entirely anonymous. 

Um, so you'd have expected, uh, on the basis of *Tantrāloka*, uh, *Mālinīvijayottara*, *Cidgāśeśvarīmata*, and *Tantrasadbhāva*, that if the syllable of s- of, uh, *Parā* were to be found in the ritual manuals it would be *sau*. In fact, we find *harsau*. And I've given you there an unnecessarily long selection, but it's, um, a section of the work called the *Kalpādikṣāpaddhati*, their standard manual for the performance of Śaiva initiation, a very elaborate ritual which lasts six days. A work composed in the 14th century but extended greatly in the time of Akbar, um, by an author called Rājānaka Śivasvāmin. And there he inserts in the ritual. Although the ritual is based upon *Svacchanda-bhairava* rather than the *Trika*, he incises, he inserts a section which is presumably designed for, um, initiates in the *Trika*, or who who s- who have a family connection with the *Trika*. So the the *mantras* of the *Trika* must also be gratified in the fire sacrifice. And he sets out all the *mantras* there. 

**Item 5: *Kalpādikṣāpaddhati* (KSTS No. 48), p. 264**

> *oṁ harsau parāyai namaḥ* (*iti* *saṁpūjā*, etc.), *oṁ harsau parāyai svāhā*. 

And in line four, you will see:

**Translation:**

> *oṁ harsau parāyai namaḥ* - First offerings of, uh, ordinary *pūjā* offerings, 
>
> …and then offerings into the fire. 
>
> *oṁ harsau parāyai svāhā* - So *namaḥ* in the first case, *svāhā* in the second. 

And you see that it's the syllable *harsau* which is used there, not, um, not *sau*. Now why is this mumbo jumbo of interest? You ma- you may, uh, ask. Well I think from the point of view of intellectual history or cultural history, what's interesting there is that we see a connection between something found in the early ninth century and something that is to be found in the anonymous - you might say almost unconscious - corpus of ritual practice maintained by the Śaiva priests who serve the Tantrik families in Kashmir. 

Um, and that r- rather alerts us to the possibility that this may be a, a continuous tradition which has been concealed from view by this success of one or two important works, and then notably the *Tantrāloka*. So we shouldn't assume. It warns us against assuming that the most important texts, the ones that seem to us to have, uh, uh, to tell us most about a tradition are the ones that are most representative of the historical reality of that tradition. This suggests perhaps that the sub-straight tradition was *Triśirā-bhairava*. And Abhinavagupta's learned exegesis of the *Mālinīvijayottara* is slightly out of tune with that ongoing sub-strain. That's the point I want to make. 

#### The Trident and the Merging of Mālinī and Parā

Now before finishing, there are two more verses. Um, so let me just look through this handout a bit further. Um, you've got the evidence on *harsau*. Yeah. Oh, there's some stuff there, item five on six, about the trident in the hand of the goddess. There's some material also on the, um. Yeah, on this fact. Um, in item five you see the goddess embodied in *harsau* is depicted in the second of Abhinavagupta's stanzas as holding a trident. This we know to be a feature of the iconography of the *Trika*'s alphabet goddess, **Mālinī**. Hm. I won't read all of that. You can check it out in your own time. Um, so she is visualized carrying a skull bowl in her one hand and a trident in the other. Um, which is not something we see with *Parā*. So it looks as though, um, we have to ask ourselves, is- is Abhinavagupta's goddess Mālinī rather than Parā? 

The correct answer to this question, I think, is that she is Mālinī, which is the alphabet goddess in the strange order beginning with *ma* and ending with *pa* rather than *a* ending with *kṣa*. Um, but rather she is Mālinī in the form of *Parā*. The two deities as it were are merged here for the purpose of, uh, uh, devotion. 

So here too the anonymous ritual manuals of the Kashmiri non-Śaiva assistants, uh, officiants, assist our comprehension. For when these officiants made of- uh, offerings to *Parā* as the goddess of the *pūrvāmnāya* - I introduced that category in an earlier lecture; this is the *kaula Trika* -  so when these officiants made of- uh, offerings to *Parā* as the goddess of the *pūrvāmnāya* in the comprehensive fire sacrifice detailed in their *Agnikāryapaddhati*, they identified her as **Mālinī**, but recited a verse that addresses her as *Parā* and encodes her sonic form as the seed syllable of that goddess. So she's worshipped as Ma- as Mālinī, but with the syllable *sau*, um. 

**Item 6: *Agnikāryapaddhati* 1.13**

> *ātmāndu-dhāmani-yugeśa-nareśa-putra-citrāṁ-triśūla-viladhāmani-sṛṣṭi-śaktim*
>
> *vaiśargiketanacitidhāmanī-pundarīkām pañcit-parāṁ trika-parāṁ praṇamāmi śaktim*

And it's a rather elegant verse, I think I read it before in an earlier lecture: 

**Translation:**

> So sometimes these works produced by the priests contain some quite elegant writing. It's not all, you know - the general view of Indian priests is that (they) are the lower order of scholarship, etc. - but occasionally something better comes through here.
>
> I bow before the goddess *Parā*, the inexpressible white *śakti* beyond the Triad, adorned by the presence in a retinue of the Lords of the Ages and the Princesses - that's the *kaula* tradition - who emits her power first in the moon center - that is the Self, that's 's' - then in the fontanel - that is the trident, that's *au* - and then in the ground of consciousness whose nature is emission. 

So this interpretation has further support from the fact that this merging of the identities of Mālinī and Parā, or rather of Parā's, uh, identity into Mālinī's, the merging of *Parā* into **Mālinī**, um, is carried forward into the *paścimāmnāya*. And this fact is further evidence in support of that development. 

For in the *Śrīmatottara* of that tradition, Mālinī's seed syllable is *husra**auṁ***, which is evidently another variant of Parā's. More specifically, a variant which I haven't mentioned before, which is also taught in the *Triśirā-bhairava*, um, which is. So this is the *Triśirā-bhairava*'s form, third form. Hm. So her, so *au* is really a prolated *au*. *Au* just draws it out further. Um, so in the *Śrīmatottara* of the *paścimāmnāya* - this is not exactly what we see. What we see is rather *husrauṁ*. And I'm simply saying this is clearly a variant of that one. Hm? The *paści- paścimāmnāya* has to assert its individuality as far as possible. It's taking over *Trika* material but spinning it slightly so it's not identical. Hm? It's inventive, you mi- you might say. Uh, yeah. There's more evidence to that effect. You can, you c- you can read from the *Kulārṇava-dīpikā*.

#### Analyzing the Final Verse: The Nara-Śakti-Śiva Triad

Now finally this last verse I want to mention, um, missing out quite a lot of material, uh, two further verses in the *Haravijaya*, which show an intimate knowledge of the *Trika*. It says "an inimate knowledge" in your handout. That's meant to be "intimate", not "inimate", or at- -mate. Aha. 

**Item 7: *Haravijaya* 47.162**

> *tat-tvaṁ bhavānī nara-śakti-śivātmakam yat*
>
> *etat-tridaśāstitam-uśanti-parāpara-jñā*
>
> *rudrānu-maṇḍala-malaṁ samabhūt tad aghā*
>
> *ajā matiṁ sanuvartanākaraṇe 'ha* 

**Translation:**

> You, Bhavānī, you O goddess, are this Triad of *nara*, *śakti*, and *śiva* that the all-knowing proclaim. The all-knowing are the followers of the *Trika*. Hm. You, Bhavānī, are this Triad of *nara*, *śakti*, and *śiva* that the all-knowing proclaim. It is you, the primal consciousness, *ādyā matiḥ*, that, enacting the will of the First Cause, have awakened the multitude of Rudra souls, or Rudra's and souls. Hm. That concludes us, it seems. Yeah. Hm.

Now the point here is that *nara-śakti* and *śiva* is a distinct signature of the *Trika*. And you have there on your handout, on pages eight and nine, a series of evidences to this effect where, uh, authors explicitly state that this is the signature doctrine of the *Trika*. That is that one reality manifests itself in these three modalities: individual consciousness, *nara* - literally "man" - *śakti*, power, and *śiva*. 

Um, and the important thing is that these are one reality with three modalities. What. This was one reality with three modalities, not three realities, or three categories of entities which are eternally distinct from each other. One reality has three forms of operation as *nara*, *śakti*, and *śiva*. And this is declared throughout our literature as a distinctive, uh, doctrine, distinctive of the *Trika*. 

**Item 8: *Triśikā-tātparyadīpikā* on *Parātriṁśikā* 10 (Kashmir Series of Texts and Studies No. 128), p. 60**

> *trikaṁ prakāśayām āsa nara-śakti-śivātmakam*. 

But I'd just like to draw your attention, um, to passage E on page nine, which is a quotation from a South Indian work, the *Triśikā-tātparyadīpikā*, horribly transmitted and fascinating. Uh, so it's very frustrating text. Uh, you can see that it's saying very interesting things, uh, and occasionally it gets into focus. You know, it's like a bad microfilm. Occasionally the text improves and you can read it, and then it fades again and you can't. Um, that's my experience of this text. Um, but it's a commentary on Abhinavagupta's commentary. Oh, no, um. It's a commentary on a South Indian commentary on the *Triśikā*, otherwise known as the *Parātriṁśikā*. And referring to the doctrine taught by Śiva in the scriptures of the *Trika* other than this *Anuttara* system taught in the *Triśikā*, um, it says: 

**Translation:**

>  Śiva has revealed through these scriptures the Triad of *nara*, *śakti*, and and *śiva*.

And then it goes on in a slightly later passage, in just quite close to it in fact, uh, five verses on, to indicate that what's specific about the *Triśikā* is that it transforms this triad into a higher form as the object, means, and agent of cognition. 

So what that passage is doing is saying, "Yeah, the normal understanding of the *Trika* is - why is it called the *Trika*? The triad? - because it teaches this triad of the individual soul called *aṇu*, *śakti*, and *śiva*. But later, in this *Triśikā* text, we have a higher revelation. Perhaps we shouldn't use the word "later" because it indicates history. But, uh, we have a higher revelation in the *Triśikā* in which this basic triad is reinterpreted in terms of the object, means, and agent of cognition." And that's the Copernican revolution I referred to earlier, which is initiated by Utpala, I think, rather than the *Triśikā*. There's no trace of that in the *Triśikā* proper. What he's talking about is Utpala's reading of the *Trika* here. 

### The Importance of Differentiation

So that's that's rather interesting because it's not often that we have in, uh, we can see in our texts, um, an almost clear admission of a change of gear in the tradition from an earlier phase to a later phase. But we *do* see this in, uh, *Śaiva* non-dualism of Kashmir. We saw it, for example, in, uh, Utpaladeva's attitude to Somānanda, saying he had introduced a tradition which was not new - it's already there in the scriptures - but it was latent. It hadn't been brought out, and now Utpaladeva and Somānanda have brought it to the fore. We can all now see clearly what the *Kāla* scriptures are really teaching us to do, which is to have direct insight into the dynamism of our cognition. A point of view strongly influenced by the *Krama*, of course. 

So you see why I think it's important to distinguish these traditions and not just talk about "Kashmiri Shaivism" - it's a kind of soup in which everything is mixed up. Um, so there are no differences that matter. The commentary commentators are doing just that. They're trying to make it all seem like one single systematic doctrine. But to see what they're up to, you have to see what they're mixing. Um, the the cultural significance is in the mixing. What's going *into* the mix? You need to be able to distinguish *Krama* elements from *Trika* elements, different elements of the *Trika* in the mix, as well, which is one of the things I'm trying to do. 

Um, so that's the first verse. 

**Item 9: *Haravijaya* 47.163**

> *sarvāprapañcopaśama-nirvikalpa-śāntātivṛtta-paratattva-śivātma-vṛtti-sūkṣmātiśūkṣma-ghana-prakṛti-śikhā’ti saṃśupta-mandalagatā paridīpyase tvam*

The second verse, which is your item 11 on page nine, I believe. Yes. Is from the same chapter of the *Hara Vijñāna*: 

**Translation:**

> "It is you that flare up, *paridīpyase tvam*, as *śikhā*, *śikhēti*, the flame, in the center of the circle of dreamless sleep. *saṃśupta-mandalagatā* -  in the circle of dreamless sleep." One with *śiva*, *śivātma-vṛtti*. Flowing in oneness with *śiva*, *śivātma-vṛtti*.  Who, as the highest stratum of reality, the *paratattva*, is free of all multiplicity, changeless, transcending even *śānta*. *śāntātivṛtta*. *śānta* is the highest, uh, segment of the manifest universe in the categorization of all of the *Śaiva*s, not just the *Śākta Śaiva*s.

Now, the proof that that, uh, is based upon a reading of the *Triśirōbhairava* - at least the probability that it is, uh - is found on page 10, uh, where I give you a citation from *Tantrāloka* six, um, in which we read. I'll just read the translation. 

**Item 10: *Tantrāloka* 6.108-109ab** 

> "This vast hierarchy of manifestation, in its two modalities as processes and entities, is grounded in its entirety in the vital energy, *prāṇe*. For what we mean by vital energy is much more than respiration and the other physiological processes of life. It is what has been termed *śikhā*, the flame, in the *Triśirōbhairava*. This flame manifests itself externally as respiration, but when that has been bound up, *buddhā*, at such times as that of worship, it ceases to oscillate, like the ordinary breath, and, as a result, becomes manifest in its inner nature as the power of consciousness that is *śiva* himself. *śivātmikā*, it becomes *śivātmikā*." 

Yeah. And I just quote there a passage from the *Viveka* on the *Tantrāloka*. Jayaratha's comment on on on this passage, these two verses I've just read out. Quoting *Triśirōbhairava*, a passage in which the term *śikhā* is indeed identified as the power of *śiva*, or rather of *bhairava* since that's the relevant name for *śiva* in this context. 

**Item 11: *Tantrāloka* 6.109ab: *Jayaratha*'s commentary**

> *śikhā* *parimitā śaktiḥ bhairavasya tu kathyate kriyāśaktir ity apiuktā*. 

Quote, 

**Translation:**

> "What we call *śikhā* is the unlimited power of *bhairava*. It is this that we are referring to when we speak of *bhairava*'s power of action." 

Actually, in the edition, it's understood that *śikhā paramitā*. The two words are separated: *śikhā paramitā*, which is nonsense. That would be "what we call *śikhā* is the limited power of *bhairava*." Ah, no. We don't want his power to be limited. The idea is said that what appears to be a power limited in the form of the *prāṇa*, the vital energies, is really an unliminate, unlimited power. It can be transformed from that into an unlimited power through being fixed at the time of worship and meditation. At which time, trance takes over, the breath dissolves, *śiva* consciousness awa- awakens. And that's the *śikhā*, the flame that shoots up, uh, bla- is from within the orb of the the state of dreamless sleep, which is the point in which the two breaths are on the point of dissolving. That's seen as the nature of *suṣupti*. In deep sleep, the breath gets subtler and subtler and subtler, and then you wake with a jerk. Unless you're fortunate, graced by the goddess, in which case, you wake up at that point. The *śikhā* surges up, and you attain, uh, blissful enlightenment. 

That seems like an auspicious sentence with which to end, so I'll I'll stop there. Thank you.
