I'm absolutely delighted to welcome back again Professor Alexis Sanderson to the Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies to present his readings. I'm sure he needs no introduction, but Professor Sanderson is the Spalding Professor of Eastern Religions and Ethics Emeritus at All Souls College. And, um, his work in on the Shivaism and the Tantric traditions — he's really opened that out, and and we've we've had we've had to rethink the history of Indian religions because of Professor Sanderson's work. It's no exaggeration to say that he's the world's leading expert in Shaivism and the Tantric traditions and and religion generally in medieval India. So it's not only the content that he's opened out for us, uh, such that we have to kind of rethink and rewrite the history of Indian religions in the medieval period, but also how to do it. I mean, he shows us how to how to how to study these traditions. Um, you go back to the sources. And by the sources, uh, Professor Sanderson means the manuscript sources. So we go back to the manuscript sources, and not only the manuscript sources, but also epigraphical sources — the that the um, you know, the grants that kings la- land grants and this sort of things. So there's a very wide kind of remit to the range of sources that Professor Sanderson looks at in order to construct or reconstruct this this history of of medieval Indian religion. And, um, uh, Shaivism, uh, Buddhism, Jainism, Vaishnavism, and and the *cāturvarṇya* traditions as well. Uh, and not only narrowly focusing on the text, but, uh, Professor Sanderson also looks over the fence at what's going on in the, um, in in the garden next door, as it were. So, I'm absolutely delighted to welcome him back to Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies, and he's going to present today the opening verses of Abhinavagupta's *Tantrāloka*. 

Thank you. Thank you, Gavin, very much for that nice introduction. It's lovely to be back — um, some familiar faces and some new ones. Um, yes, as Professor Flood said, I'm going to do the opening verses of Abhinavagupta's *Tantrāloka*. Two years ago, I read the *Upōdgātā*, the introductory section of the *Tantrāloka* here from the first *Āhnika*, which begins at verse 22 and goes on to 122. And my first idea was that I would continue, just press on, perhaps finish the first *Āhnika*. But then I always had it on my conscience that I'd avoided doing the first 21 verses, which are form a unit in themselves, uh, from the *Ādibhaṭṭikā*, the preface or introduction. Um, and unlike prefaces to Western works, which tend to be rather bland and courteous and illogical and so forth, Abhinavagupta's *Ādibhaṭṭikā* is immensely dense and full of very interesting information — *if* you know what to look for. Um, of course, much of it is benedictory, um, as is as is normal in an Indian Sanskrit work, but the content of the benedictions is very interesting. And it also involves, uh, acknowledging his various teachers, and by doing that we get some sense of the complex interaction of various traditions which have flown into his understanding, have come into his understanding, which he's drawn into his understanding, which are not just scriptural literature. Now, he's very far from what *we* would call an objective scholar. He's not a historian of Shaivism. He is constructing, uh, a vision of Shaivism, a way of reading Shaivism for his time. And his time is an extremely sophisticated one. Um, Kashmir is a a tiny country. Um, it's ha- it's land — it's inhabitable land area is not much larger than the county of Kent. Now, we don't know the population, um, but I would say it's very unlikely to have ever been more than half a million. Possibly more, but I think not very likely. Of whom, what percentage were learned Brahmans? Presumably rather a small percentage. So, it's a bit like ancient Athens in a way. It's a small community in a very isolated part of the world, um, extraordinarily creative, uh, between the 8th and, uh, 11th centuries. Uh, particularly in the domain of Shaivism, but not *only* in the domain of Shaivism. Um, Kashmiri and cultural, uh, productivity or creativity in the religious sphere begins in the 2nd century AD with extraordinary contributions to Buddhism. Buddhism was the first religion in Kashmir, in my view. We have no evidence that Brahmanism was there in the 2nd century AD. The first evidence of anything Brahmanical, and associated Shaiva and Vaiṣṇava phenomena, uh, comes up in the 4th and 5th centuries. And it seems to me very possible what we're looking at is a situation in which, um, North Indian influences from the Gupta area, um, or and their predecessors had almost no impact on Kashmir. It was part of a larger, uh, Buddhist world — including Gandhāra, Taxila, Kapisha, and these other places — um, and it was only secondarily that Brahmanical culture was introduced. Uh, and when once it had been, it was greatly developed. And the Brahmans who came in came from all parts of India, uh, brought in by kings through land grants, uh, who clearly invested on a grand scale in in bringing in, uh, learned men who were unable to say no to offers they couldn't refuse. "Would you like, uh, 5 acres of prime agricultural land and 100 serfs to to to farm them by the Vitastā River in the Kashmir Valley?" These are attractive offers, and people accepted them. So, Abhinavagupta's ancestor, Atrigupta, was a Brahman of Madhyadeśa — probably a Kānyakubja Brahman; we're not quite sure. And he was brought in by the, uh, in in the Kashmir king Lalitāditya and given a a a land grant by the Vitastā River — and literally on the banks of the Vitastā, with a splendid view of the mountains in the north. We can roughly guess where it was, in fact. Um, and there the family stayed. And although they'd come in from Madhyadeśa, they don't refer to themselves as Madhyadeśīya, as Brahmans of Madhyadeśa. They call themselves Kāśmīraka. And that also raises an interesting question about national identity among Brahmans, 'cause Brahmans are on the move. They don't always stay forever in one area. Uh, rather like the middle class in the north of England, they don't think of themselves as *really* there. They *happen* to be there for the time being, but they are, like Brahmans, mobile. They *could* go anywhere, in principle. They're not autochthonous, so to speak. So when Abhinavagupta calls himself a Kāśmīraka, which is the correct form of the the the the word for a Kashmiri in in in Sanskrit, um, he's not claiming that his ancestors, uh, have been Kashmiris from the beginning of time. He's simply saying that "I am *now* a Kashmiri" by nationality, as *we* might say if we've lived in France for two, three generations — that we are French. And there *is* this very strong sense of national identity among Kashmiris. Most Sanskrit authors do *not* refer to their nationality. It seems to be very unusual, this strong sense of national identity that the Kashmiri and Brahmans have. They frequently refer them- to themselves as Kashmiris, but this is not so common among other groups of Brahmans. There are *some* exceptions, but on the whole they use — people identify themselves through *caste* and *gotra* and learning rather than nationality. But the Kashmiris stand out in having this strong sense of national identity. 

Now, so I've decided to do these opening verses. In fact, I'm going to start by doing only one of them, which is the opening verse, verse 1. Um, and by the time of Abhinavagupta, it had been the convention in India for many centuries that an author should open a composition — it's a grand composition like this — with a form of words designed to promote the successful completion, um, of of the work by dispelling the hindering powers — the *vighnaha* — the hindering powers that were believed to strive to impede completion of *any* pious endeavor. And these impediments are abstract entities — like laziness, um, torpor, ill health, and so forth — that get in the way of completing a a project. But they're also personified as deities. There's a whole *mass* in in in the cultural outlook here of beings that are whose purpose is to get in the way of completion of *any* pious endeavor. So, we have this, um, model that orthodox Brahmanism is facing this *major* enemy at all times — this invisible *horde* of obstructive forces. So, you must guard against their in- their eruption by *every* means. Hence, absolute orthopraxy is neces- is necessary. If you infringe *any* of the regulations, you're in a state of vulnerability to possession. These creatures will come in and deflect you. So, this is the kind of environment in which he's beginning his work. Um, so, from the 4th or 5th century AD onwards, this auspicious beginning verse was commonly one in which the author turned to the deity, or deities plural, of his personal devotion — his *iṣṭadevatā* — expressing his obeisance — *namaskāra* — or supplication — *āśīrvāda* or *āśāṃsāvācanam*. The opening verse of the *Tantrāloka* exemplifies the second of these forms because it is a prayer for enlightenment. It's an *āśīrvāda*. It's *not* a *praṇāma* verse. It's a *āśīrvāda* seeking enlightenment and wishing it on on others. So, let's first read it: 

> *Vimala kalāśrayābhīnavasṛṣṭimahājananīṃ baritatānuṣṭapaṃśamoktaguptārūcīrjanakā tadubhayayāmalasphuritabhāvavisargam ayam śrīdayaṃ amṛtāramṛtakolam mama saṃsphuratāt* 

Um, it's an immensely, uh, tricky verse. It's superficially straightforward, but there all kinds of ambiguities. One of the most *incorrect* things I was ever taught as a student in, as a Sanskritist, was that, um, Sanskrit is a wonderfully clear language. *No*, it isn't! It *can* be, but the learned go to *great lengths* to make sure that it isn't. They leave a *high* level of ambiguity there. It's for the reader — out of courtesy, if you like, or challenge to the reader — to be able to remove the the other possibilities through a dense and detailed knowledge of context. So, the learned are writing for the learned, for the most part. They're not writing handbooks for schoolboys and schoolgirls. They're writing to each other. And this makes life *quite* difficult — considering how short life is! I mean, to get into position where one can actually root out the, um, the alternative meanings i- it's it's *not* easy. Um, and Jayaratha, uh, our *only* surviving commentator on the *Tantrāloka*, a 13th-century author, long time after the writing of the *Tantrāloka* itself, um, is a, uh — his commentary is a great achievement, but it's *not* always right, in my view. It's often arbitrary. It stays on the road on on — it stays doctrinally on the road. It doesn't go off into the ditch. Um, but I think often its interpretations are somewhat arbitrary. And I don't hesitate to disagree with him. Um, it's *not* our job to to to to p- massively, uh, accept *everything* that every scholar from the early medieval period says. We have to use our *own* judgment. 

So, let me first parse the sentence for you. Go to the last line, the last quarter-verse: *hṛdayam mama samsphuratāt*. I'll give a literal translation first. "May my heart — *mama hṛdayam samsphuratāt* — may it flash forth, may it burst forth, may it be fully illumined." *Samsphuratāt*, this is a Prakrit imperative. Then it's *not* much used in classical Sanskrit, other than in our Śaiva *vāda*s. It's a form of the imperative: *hṛdayam mama samsphuratāt*. Um, and the qualification there is *anuttarāmṛtakulam*, which is — *mayam*, full of — from the suffix *-mayat*, which in Sanskrit has a number of meanings. Um, full of, replete with — *pracura, pracurāt mayat*; um, also, it can mean a transformation of something, a product of something — like *gomayam*, cow dung, from *go*, cow. Um, or, and in in later usages — very much so in Vedāntic usage — it means "one with". So, *ānandamaya* — "consisting of nothing but." There are yet other usages — "intent upon". Um, *manmaya*. Krishna says in the *Bhagavadgītā*, um, "*not* being one with me, but devoted to me, intent on me, thinking of nothing but me, focused on me". So, *-mayat* actually, which is treated as a suffix by the Sanskrit grammarians, um, has quite a wide range of meanings. Um, but here I take it in the sense of *pracura, pracurīye* — "replete with", "full of". Full of what? Um, or "embodying", also we could say, um, "the bliss of the ultimate — *anuttarāmṛta*". There you see ambiguity: it could be *anuttara* and *amṛta*. I take it to be *amṛta*, in the sense of "bliss" — literally, the nectar, the deathless, which in this discourse is often used as the synonym of *ānanda*, um, "the bliss of the ultimate — *anuttarāmṛta*", *kulam*. So, may it flash forth, um, *tadudvayayāmalasphuritābhāvavisargamyam*. Here we see, um, *mayam* — sorry, I I'd ra- rather conf- I got slightly confused there. In *anuttarāmṛtakulam*, I talked though we were reading *anuttarāmṛtamayaṃ*, which would have worked perfectly well — actually, the sense would have been much the same. But in fact *kulam* here is being used in the sense of "body" — *kulam śarīre*. Now, this is not just a specialist use of *kula*s. This is a use found in ordinary Sanskrit as well. The the lexicographers list that as one of the meanings of *kula*: *kulam dehe*, *kulam śarīre*. Um, so whose body i- which embodies the bliss of the ultimate — *anuttarāmṛtakulam*. And which is also *tadudvayayāmalasphuritābhāvavisargamyam*: "consisting of" or "replete with" — *mayam* — the *visarga*. Now, *visarga* means "emission", "sending forth", "creation", but also also, uh, "emission". Um, and I've translated it here as "infinite creative power", because that is how *visarga* is understood in the metaphysical contact- context. It's that power of consciousness whereby it has an infinite creative potential to manifest itself itself as our complex universe. So, this **heart** to which he is praying, whose manifestation he he seeks, consists of that infinite creative power — *visargamayaṃ* — which is *sphuritābhāva*: "that whose nature — *bhāva* — has become manifest — *sphuritā*, has shone forth" — *sphuritābhāva*, *tadudvayayāmalā*, "in the union — *yāmale*", I'm translating in a a a a a a a a a a loose-ish of sense — "of these two" — *tadudvayayāmalasphuritābhāvavisargamayaṃ*, *hṛdayam anuttarāmṛtakulam mama samsphuratāt*. So, who are these two? What is this — the *pair* from whose union this infinite creative potential is manifested? That's covered in the first two lines, the first two part- parts of the verse: *vimala kalāśrayābhīnavasṛṣṭimahājananī*, "the mother — *jananī* — whose radiance — *mahā*, *mahā* in the sense of *tejas* — is in ever new creation — *abhīnavasṛṣṭimahā* — whose radiance is in ever new creation and is *vimala kalāśrayā*, whose ground, whose support, whose basis — *āśraya* — is pure *kalā*". Which we might translate — um, *kalā* here is used as a synonym of ideation. Now, *I'm* using the word "ideation" to translate *vimarśa*. So, in this Kashmirian non-dualism, in on the philosophical side derived or elaborated by Utpaladeva and subsequently expanded by, uh, Abhinavagupta above all, reality is seen as the coexistence, the *inseparability* of the light of consciousness and its dynamism. Because, consciousness is something dynamic in this system. It is *not* something on which *we* superimpose action through illusion. Consciousness *is* inherently dynamic in *all* its manifestations. So, *she*, the mother — metaphorically speaking, the mother — *śakti*, "whose radiant in ever new creation and whose substrate, whose basis is the power of ideation — *kalā* — without any taint — *vimalā*". So, *uncontracted, untrammeled, untainted, pure, infinite* power of ideation. So, it's an absolute autonomy. That's what *tantrika śakti* — "power of absolute autonomy". There's nothing it can't do. It is, by definition, autonomous. It needs *nothing* outside itself in order to exist. It exists through itself alone. 

And the father — *janakā* — who is *paritatānu* — "all-containing". Literally, whose nature — *tanu* is used here in the sense of *ātman* — whose nature is *parita*, "full to overflowing, all-containing". And this is a subtle allusion to the *nirvacana*m of the word *bhairava*. The word *bhairava* is regularly glossed by the commentators as meaning *parita*, employing the word *parita* — "literally, full". So, *bhairava* is that is Śiva perceived in his, uh, all-embodying nature. So, we ju- they distinguish between, um, Śiva as *sarvotīrṇā*, as a as a visualized as transcending *all* lower levels of reality, as the *highest* reality. But, um, *not* as other than the manifest universe. So, ultimately he expands, as it were, into a a *viśvamaya*, all-embodying reality, and in that all-inclusive reality he is often referred to as *bhairava*, as opposed to Śiva, in this non-dualistic Śaiva discourse. So, um, the Trika system, which is what is being expounded in *Tantrāloka*, claims that its specificity is that it recognizes *both* these polarities of consciousness: that it is *simultaneously*, by a kind of miracle, both all-transcending and all-embodying. Like cognition on our *own* small scale. So, the *saiddhāntika*s are seen to perceive Śiva as *viśvotīrṇa*, "world-transcending", um, as indeed they do. Um, but Abhinavagupta doesn't follow that view. He says, um, "Śiva does not exist somewhere, transcending all other powers of manifestation like a pot, a a concrete entity somehow above everything else, on top of the pile. *No*. He is this very light of consciousness manifest as our experience." It's a a different perspective. Um, but for Kṣemarāja, in the — the pupil of Abhinavagupta, in his rather useful little work, the *Pratyabhijñāhṛdayam*, he points out that the *śākta*s believe that Śiva is *viśvamaya*, the *saiddhāntika*s that he is *viśvotīrṇa*, but *we*, followers of systems such as the Trika and the Krama, hold that he is *both*: both transcendent and all-embodying. And that is the nature of consciousness — to be *both*. Whether it's the consciousness of an ant or the consciousness of consciousness itself, so to speak. 

Yeah, um, *vimala kalāśrayābhīnavasṛṣṭimahājananī paritatānuśca* *pañcamukhaguptārūcīrjanakā*. "The father whose *ārūci*", here in the sense of *prakāśa*, "whose innate light, whose radiance" — the the light of reality, which is actually the light of consciousness — "is *gupta*", "preserved, maintained through his five *mukha*s. *śāktīvimukhamihocyate*", as the as the *vimarśina bhairava* says. The word *mukha*, literally "mouth" or "channel", here refers to *śakti*. Um, in the language of these texts, *mukha*m can be used in the sense of, um, um, one of consciousness's — consciousness's constitutive powers. And these are five, in this context: consciousness, bliss, pre-cognitive impulse, cognition, and action — *cit*, *ānanda*, *icchā*, *jñānam*, and *kriyā*. These five powers. So, this totality, seen from the point of view of *bhairava*, is a state of, uh, the light of consciousness maintained at all times through the operation of these five powers. Not *just* *cit* and *ānanda*, but *all* five. Nothing lies outside this reality. Um, and if you like, from a s- from a Krama perspective, *kriyā* is the *highest* of these powers. It's the most inclusive, the most non-dual. Um, yes, perhaps that's a little bit difficult to grasp, but the idea is that if you were to define ultimate reality only as the highest, you're excluding everything else. This *higher* non-duality includes *everything*, including duality. It's *all* real. Consciousness has this miraculous power — this miraculous power — this miraculous power to appear as *everything* while remaining one. While remaining undivided. Just like our own consciousness, from moment to moment. 

Yeah. So, let me read through the translation again, um, slightly less, uh, free — I pr- or rather, slightly *more* free than the one I've [MISSING AUDIO SEGMENT] are themselves that which they are to experience." Unquote. [MISSING AUDIO SEGMENT] or the object of limited "I"-consciousness. This then is the function and purpose of the verse. Through it, Abhinavagupta expresses his own immersion in the true, in the expansion of the ultimate, holding in new non-duality all the mouths, all the *śakti*s, that will emerge thereafter. It is this that is meant in the scriptures by such terms as the **heart**, the inner pulse — *spanda* — cognition — *vṛt* — , *Parā*, which is the highest goddess. It is the seed of the universe, beautiful with the all-embracing bliss that surges up in the expansion of the ultimate. Uh, so there's a dup- duplication there: "holding in non-duality all the mouths that will emerge thereafter". Excuse the dup- lication. "It is this that is meant in the scriptures by such terms", et cetera. Sorry. Um, here the contraction caused by the inhibition of consciousness through the emergence of differentiated entities has fallen away, and the three powers that are the conscious subject's precognitive impulse, cognition, and action have become nothing but that subject's state of immersion in his own bliss. The master Somānanda taught this when he declared in his *Śivadṛṣṭi*, "When one rests immersed in the experience of the unmingled bliss of one's consciousness, then one's precognitive impulse, cognition, and action are no more than that experience. One exists as the fusion of those three powers in their subtlest form. At that time, one is undivided, completely immersed in the bliss that is consciousness." 

Um, um. Yeah, so this is, um, the first piece of evidence in favor of my interpretation of the **core** as *ānanda*, this fusion of the two and the three. The second passage comes from *Tantrāloka* itself, and you have it there. Uh, I translate it as follows: "So this universe is a reflection in the Lord, in the perfectly reflective void of *Bhairava*'s consciousness, and arises under the influence of nothing outside that consciousness. This ability of the Lord to embody himself as the universe without drawing on anything outside his own nature is the supreme goddess that our masters call creativity — *pratibhā* — the feminine ultimate — *anuttarā*. It is the supreme power of universality — *kaulīkī śakti* — the power by which consciousness can manifest itself as everything. The ability of this deity, *Bhairava*, embodied in the sound *a* — *akūlasya* — to manifest the universe — *kulā prathanāśālinī* — although transcending it — *akūlasya* — the power by which the Lord is ever one — this power — *kaulīkī śakti* — from which the Lord — i.e., consciousness as *prakāśa* — is *never* separated". If *prakāśa* was separated from *vimarśa*, it would be *dead*. There'd be no act of awareness of any kind. "The combination — *yāmalam rūpam* — of these two is dynamic fusion — the dynamic fusion — *saṃghattaḥ* — that enables the universe to be emitted into consciousness. It is *this* that we mean by the power of bliss — *ānandaśakti*. This is the ultimate reality beyond both the universe-transcending and the universal. It is the Goddess — *Devī* — the essence — *sattvam* — and the **core** — *hṛdayam*. It is the highest omnipotent state of absolute potential." So, I think that drives the point home fairly fairly clearly. Um, um. So, the **core** that Abhinavagupta invokes as the source of inspiration and the goal to be realized is the state of absolute potential in which the three powers of precognitive impulse, cognition, and action and the three modes of plurality, synthesis, and non-duality are fused in blissful all-embracing consciousness. 

Now, it might be thought that, in making **this** the object of his prayer, Abhinavagupta has disregarded the convention that such verses should invoke the author's chosen deity, his *iṣṭadevatā*, for it would appear that this **core** is *no* deity at all, but at best the **ground** in which *Bhairava* and his power mingle and lose their separate identities. But the breach of convention is only apparent. For at the center of Abhinavagupta's pantheon of contemplation and worship is a Goddess who **is** this **core**. He is merely leaving his readers to recognize her for themselves. This — so like the reality she personifies — she is pervasive in his work, but veiled and concealed. One doesn't *name* the the object of one's true love, as it were. This is *Kālasaṃkarṣiṇī*, the destroyer of time, the goddess of the *Krama*. *Kālasaṃkarṣaṇī*, not *-inī*, although *-inī* often appears in many in the editions. *Kālasaṃkarṣiṇī*, "the destroyer of time". She who destroys time. Um, the *maṇḍala* that enthrones the Trika's deities and symbolizes their interrelation is known as the *Triśūlābja Maṇḍala*. Um, I I'm sorry, I'm a hopeless — I'm hopeless at drawing. I I won't re- try. But the the name is *Triśūlābja Maṇḍala*, and this consists of the usual square enclosure. Um, at the center is a trident — with three prongs, of course. And on the tips of the trident are three lotuses, and the three goddesses of the Trika sit enthroned on those three lotuses. Um, at its center is a trident with a lotus on the cusp of each of its three prongs. On these lotuses, three Goddesses are installed: *Parā* in the center, *Parāparā* to her right, and *Aparā* to her left — i.e., to *our* right. And that's the norm in the Trika. These three goddesses are worshipped as a triad. Hence, the name "Trika". But in Abhinavagupta's form of the Trika, this triadic struct- structure has been, as it were, um, overcoded by a tetradic system taken from the *Krama*, and a fourth goddess is added *above* the central — the goddess on the central cusp, and that is *Kālasaṃkarṣiṇī*, in the system of the *Deviyāgamala*. Now, the *Deviyāgamala* does not survive, unfortunately. At least, it hasn't come to light yet. It's *not* likely to come to light in Kashmir now. Um, and I've found *no* trace of it in Nepal, the only other likely source of such a survival. Um, but it's often referred to by Abhinavagupta. So, we know *something* about what is distinctive of it. It is an *important* part of his scriptural synthesis — the way he puts together *his* Trika. So, in the Trika of the *Deviyāgamala*, um, it is ruled that *Kālasaṃkarṣiṇī* should be installed above *Parā* as the ultimate ground. And you'll see that in your, um, uh, item three on page three, where it says, "Deities of the *Mahādamarāyāga*" — *yāga* here means *maṇḍala*, in Trika tech- technical terminology, rather than "worship" — and is called the *Mahādamarā*, the *yāga* of the primal sacrifice known as the *Mahādamarā*. Um, and it says, "The goddess *Parā* is on the central cusp, *Parāparā* on the cusp to her right, and *Aparā* on the cusp to her left. Learn that the illustrious goddess *Kālasaṃkarṣiṇī* is established transcending *Parā*, above the central cusp." And, uh, there's also a passage here from Abhinavagupta's treatment of the *maṇḍala* taught in the *Deviyāgamala*. That's your item four. And he writes, "Above it, he should trace another lotus on the area at the middle of the staff of the trident. Then he should trace the third lotus at the upper limit of the central cusp of the trident, and in the same way two others flanking it to the right and left on the lateral cusps of the trident. The seed pods at the center of the lotuses should be yellow; each of the se- each of the filaments should have three equal segments colored red, yellow, and white. The petals on the boundary line around each lotus should be white. The trident should be colored in with black powder, but it should have a white vertical line along its axis. Its tip should have flames added with red powder, and the staff in which the trident is fixed should be colored yellow. He should always proceed by worshipping Sadāśiva in the lotus at the center of the trident, and then *Parā* above him on the cusp of the central blade, the next goddess *Parāparā* on her right, and *Aparā* on her left. Above *Parā*, the goddess *Kālasaṃkarṣiṇī* is present, constantly engaged in the resorption of this array of the deities of the trident, accomplishing this simply through her spontaneous power or urge." And then, uh, uh, one more passage, uh, again taken from the *Tantrāloka*. "It is called *Kālasaṃkarṣiṇī* in the *Deviyāgamala*, in which she is worshipped above *Parā*, and it is called *Mātṛsadbhavā* in the *Mālinīvijayottara*." Well, *that's* a bit of a cheat, actually, because there *is* a *Mātṛsadbhavā* goddess, or or deity, in the *Mālinīvijayottara*, but there's *no* reason to associate *it* with *Kālasaṃkarṣiṇī*. It's *structurally* parallel. So, *Parā*, as it were, has two aspects in the *Mālinīvijayottara* system, a higher and lower. And Abhinavagupta, of course, connects that with the *Deviyāgamala*'s tetradic structure, thereby feeding the *Krama*, *Kālasaṃkarṣiṇī*-based tradition into the understanding of the Trika. Um, uh. Uh, so what I'm saying is that although the first verse *seems* to be specified by no specific deity, in fact he's alluding to *Kālasaṃkarṣiṇī*. 

And this is interesting because it shows that although in a sense this is a Śaiva text — all these are Śaiva texts, uh, if you said to Abhinavagupta, "You're no Śaiva", he would be *most* offended: "No! I *am* a Śaiva!" — but the *very essence* of Śiva is the Goddess. The *hidden* essence of Śiva is the Goddess. And the *highest* forms of worship are directed towards the contemplation of *Kālasaṃkarṣiṇī*. This point in Śiva's nature which Śiva cannot get behind behind and perceive his immediate identity — *that* is the goddess. So, they are crypto-Śāktas, we can say. Although, externally to the world they're Śaivas, they may have very Śaiva marks in their personal devotion, they're actually devotees of the goddess. Although, "devotion" here is — why, it may include *bhakti*, in the traditional sense — it's a highly contemplative business. And if you were to ask Abhinavagupta seriously, "Well, *what is* the goddess?", you'd have to say, "Well, it is the power of ideation that constitutes the very essence of manifestation." So, in a sense we see here, um, a a strong urge to rationalize, um, a system which is rooted in, um, rather less rational things, if you like — more emotional, and indeed magical notions — an attempt to rationalize, and in a sense to dissolve the theistic content in a way, or rather, to re- re-program it in some rather radical way. And in this — in this sense, the difference between, um, late Buddhism and Śaivism is *not* very great. They're *both* forms of atheism, in a way. In the sense that the naive belief in a kind of formed deity which demands your submission and adoration has been obliterated through metaphysical speculation. What is the — what is Śiva? What is the goddess? *Prakāśa* and *Vimarśa*. What is Cakrasaṃvara? — the embodiment of compassion and emptiness. Various ways have been elaborated which deconstruct theism, in a sense. And therefore,And therefore, in a in a way bring Indian religion, um, more in keeping with, um, mainstream brāhmanical thinking, which is also strongly atheistic in a way — at least in its metaphysics — Mīmāṃsā — and also Vedānta, which, of course, distinguishes, in mature Vedānta, between *saguṇa brahma* and *nirguṇa brahma*, but it's the *nirguṇa brahma* that is the ultimate reality. The *saguṇa brahma* is the benefit of the unenlightened, as it were, who project onto the qualityless Absolute, human or theistic attributes. So, I think in a way it is rather interesting here, because I feel, in Abhinavagupta's writing, a *strong* devotion in a way, but it's a wild dog that he's trying to keep on a lead, you know? He's constantly coming back to a more metaphysical, contemplative standpoint. And the same is true of Utpaladeva, the great founder of the Pratyabhijñā philosophical system, two generations before — scholastic generations before Abhinavagupta. He seems to have initiated, in a sense, this rereading of the theological categories in terms of epistemological or metaphysical entities. Yet he also produced a collection of hymns that were redacted after his death into the *Śivastotrāvalī*, where we see also an expression of intense devotion. So, here — here's the nature of religion: it serves more than one purpose! And the great thing about it is it doesn't *have* to be entirely coherent. And the same is true of tantric worship. If you go into the *structure* of it, and ask, "Well, what does it *mean*? What is it expressing?" — *contradictory* things! On the one hand, devotion to the deity; on the other hand, saying that the deity is nothing but oneself. Um, so, in a sense, the function of ritual, in a sense, is to enable contradictions, contrary urges to be combined, and excused, in a sense. You deal with *both* requirements: both the devotional and the metaphysical. Both the devotional and the magical, in a sense, as well. Because, the idea is that, by identifying yourself with Śiva, *you* acquire the powers of Śiva. *You* can direct the ritual to mundane ends, as though you *were* Śiva himself. There's magic in there as well. Yeah, um. So, our **core** is none other than this fourth goddess. But there's one more meaning — the second meaning — which I must briefly explain. 

While invoking *Kālasaṃkarṣiṇī*, the fourth goddess, as the embodiment of the highest reality, Abhinavagupta *also* alludes to his own birth from the union of his parents, Vimalā and Narasiṃhagupta: *Pañcamukhaguptārūcīre*. Here, *ruci* means "his name" — whose name was Pañcamukhagupta. Pañcabuka is a name for a for a lion, in a sense. *Pañca* — nothing to do with the number five, by the way, rather from a root meaning "to open wide". So, a lion is one who opens its mouth wide when it roars, so it's a name for — as in *pratāñca*, same root, *pañcamukha*. So, Pañcamukhagupta means Siṃhagupta, and Siṃhagupta is short for for Narasiṃhagupta, by a kind a very common kind of abbreviation. Just as the name Satyabrahmā can be "Brahmā", by abbreviation, so Narasiṃhagupta can be Siṃhagupta. Um, so the second reading hidden within the verse is alluding to the names of his parents: Vimalā and Narasiṃhagupta. 

"Information on his parents would be inappropriate in this context", you may think, "were it not that it is no ordinary act of procreation that Abhinavagupta brings to mind. When reading this verse, one looks for the second meaning because the words *janakā* and *jananī* are rather surprising in that context." And it's always some incon- incongruity of that kind, some *slight* incongruity, which leads the reader to look for a second meaning. Because, in order to combine two meanings in one verse, one must fit slightly less well than the other. One must look slightly more artificial. And so *janakā* and *jananī* look a *bit* artificial if you were *just* trying to make a metaphysical statement. Why — why say that? Just say *Vimarśa* and *Prakāśa*. Um, so that alerts one to look for some reference to a *real* mother and father, and we have it, um, encoded in *vimalakālāśrayā* and *pañcamukhaguptārūcīre janakāt*. So, the reason why it's *not* an appalling *doṣa* to refer to his procreat- the act of his procreation, um, is that what he's referring to here is no *ordinary* act of procreation. It is rather the supramundane sexual union practiced in the course of worship by those initiated in the *kaula* form of Śākta Śaivism. For, as he will explain in *Āhnika* 29 of the *Tantrāloka*, in the climax of his treatise, the sexual act is practiced there as a means of realizing precisely the state of absolute potential — *visarga* — adumbrated in this opening verse. This internal condition of immersion in that state of absolute potential, which differentiates this union from the mundane — from mundane copulation — is indicated by Abhinavagupta in the epithet *parītātanu*, which I take to indicate the state of inclusive universality that characterizes this absolute. Jayaratha claims in his commentary that this epithet should be construed as referring to *both* Vimalā and Narasiṃhagupta, the precondition of *kaula* union being that *both* should be immersed in awareness of themselves as Śiva and his consort. He explains, moreover, that, by including this reference to *kaula* union in the opening verse, Abhinavagupta indicates the preeminence of the *kaula* form of the Trika, which he sees as the *most* direct means of evoking the state of the **core**, and thereby attaining enlightenment. Although the greater part of his text will be devoted to the tantric form of the system — the *tantra prakṛyā* — the *whole* exposition will be pervaded by the principles of the *kula tantra* — *kaula* principles. In short, it is a work on the tantric and *kaula* forms of the Trika, from the standpoint of the latter. 

Jayaratha, the commentator, also explains that Abhinavagupta, in informing his readers that he himself is the product of such an enlightened union, is telling them that *he* is competent to instruct *his* readers in the nature and means of enlightenment. For, he tells us elsewhere that *anyone* who has conceived through such a union comes into this world already the receptacle of enlightenment. That for which *others* must strive is *his* naturally. And I think I've given you a couple of quotes, then, yeah, under item six. "The expression 'all-embracing'" — this is a quotation from Jayaratha's commentary. He's commenting on the word *parītātanu* in the in the root verse. "The expression *parītātanu* should be construed in accordance with the maxim of the crow's eye, to qualify both that which follows — the father — and that which precedes — the mother. Because *both* are required by such scriptural texts as the following to aim to merge themselves with the state of immersion experienced by Śiva and Śakti." Quote: "They should meditate in each other on the nature that is Śiva and his Śakti. They should not entertain human ideas of each other involving lust, delusion, and the rest. The highest adepts should do everything with the cultivation of enlightenment in mind." So, because he tells us that he is, in this way, the product of such a union — that is to say, of the union of parents who are little less than a *siddha* and a *yoginī* — the author claims that he himself is a receptacle of the non-dual knowledge that is the ultimate.
