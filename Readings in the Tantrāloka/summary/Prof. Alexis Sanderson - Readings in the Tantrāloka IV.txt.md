## A Deep Dive into the Teachings of Abhinavagupta: Exploring theSource Text

This document delves into a detailed exploration of the provided source text, expanding upon the previously established structural framework. We will unpack the layers of meaning embedded within each subtopic, chapter, concept, idea, phrase, keyword,and term, drawing upon both the source text and a broader understanding of the philosophical context.

### I. Introduction: The Teacher and the Lineages

Thesource text opens by introducing a significant figure in Kashmiri Shaivism: **Śrīkaṇṭha**. Often understood as an epithet of Shiva, the term embodies the divine energy and wisdom at the heart of this tradition.The source text declares: "**Śrīkaṇṭha is the teacher of all**." This statement underscores the profound influence of Śrīkaṇṭha as a guiding force within this lineage, implying that his teachings permeate thevarious branches stemming from him.

The text highlights the existence of "**three and a half lineages**," a curious phrase that immediately piques our curiosity. These lineages, originating from Śrīkaṇṭha, are not merely organizational structures but represent distinct streams of transmission. Each lineage carries a unique understanding and practicewithin the broader umbrella of Śaivism. These lineages are living traditions, dynamically evolving as they are passed down through generations of disciples. The text emphasizes the expansive nature of these transmissions, stating that they "**have spread out into hundreds of branches through their disciples and the disciples of their disciples**." This branching outsignifies the adaptability of the teachings, allowing them to resonate with diverse individuals and contexts while maintaining a connection to their source.

Central to our understanding of these lineages is the text "*Tantrāloka*." This seminal work, authored by Abhinavagupta, a prominent Kashmiri Shaiva philosopher, servesas a crucial lens through which we can approach these complex traditions. 

### II. Six Streams of Revelation: A Synthesis of Śaivism

The text emphasizes the *Tantrāloka*'s all-encompassing nature, stating: "**This *Tantrāloka* exudesall the flavors of Śaivism because it has absorbed those of the essences of all six streams of revelation**." This statement positions the *Tantrāloka* not as a text limited to a single lineage but as a synthesis of diverse Śaiva perspectives. It embodies a spirit of inclusivity,drawing upon the "**essences**" – the core principles and practices – of six distinct streams of revelation.

Let's now delve into these six streams, understanding that the text provides a concise overview rather than an exhaustive exposition:

1. ***Siddhānta***: This term, oftentranslated as "established doctrine" or "conclusive teaching," represents a prominent school of thought within Shaivism. Siddhānta traditions are characterized by their emphasis on scriptural authority, systematic philosophical inquiry, and a devotional approach to Shiva as the Supreme Reality. 

2. ***ĀmardakaSantana***: This lineage is less well-known than *Siddhānta* but holds significant importance in understanding the breadth of Śaiva thought. Unfortunately, the source text doesn't provide details about this tradition. Further research using external sources would be necessary to understand its specific doctrines and practices.

3. ***Vāma* (Left-hand path):** This stream, often referred to as the "left-hand path" due to its unconventional practices, emphasizes the transformative power of engaging with the world and its energies. The *Vāmasrotas*, as this tradition is known, is specificallylinked to the worship of Tumburu and his four sisters: Jayā, Vijayā, Ajantī, and Aparājitā. This pantheon of deities, particularly the prominence of the four sisters, points toward a strong *Śākta* influence. *Śākta* traditions center on the divine feminineprinciple, often personified as a goddess (*Devi*) who embodies power, wisdom, and creative energy. Tumburu, a celestial musician in Hindu mythology, seems to play a secondary, almost chaperone-like role in this particular *Vāmasrotas* context.

4. ***Dakṣiṇa* (Right-hand path):** Representing the more orthodox path, the *Dakṣiṇa* stream contrasts with the *Vāma* in its approach to spiritual practice. It emphasizes ethical conduct, ritual purity, and a more gradual path toward liberation. The *Dakṣiṇasrotas*, the specific term used for this stream, centers on the worship of Svaccchandabhairava, a fierce form of Shiva associated with liberation and the transcendence of limitations. Interestingly, the text mentions that the *Dakṣiṇasrotas* influenced *Siddhānta* thought in "**crucial ways**," hinting at a dynamic exchange of ideas between these seemingly distinct streams.

5. ***Bhautikatantras*/*Buddhatantras***: These Tantras, often grouped together, deal with the realm of spirits and supernatural forces. The text primarily associates them with demonology andexorcism, practices aimed at mitigating the negative influence of malevolent spirits. While not directly related to the primary theological concerns of Śaivism, the inclusion of these Tantras highlights the practical aspects of Tantric traditions, addressing immediate human concerns alongside the pursuit of liberation. 

6. ***Garuḍatantras***: Focused on healing and protection, the *Garuḍatantras* address the dangers posed by poisons, particularly snakebites. This specialization reflects the environmental realities of ancient and medieval India, where venomous creatures were a genuine threat. The inclusion of these Tantras emphasizes the holistic approach of Śaivism, acknowledging the importance of physical well-being alongside spiritual growth.

The text then introduces a significant point: the *Krama* tradition, often associated with the *Kaulas*, is considered the **sixth *Srotas*** (stream). This categorization is notable because *Krama* practicesare often considered highly esoteric and even transgressive within the broader spectrum of Tantric traditions. By including the *Krama* as a distinct stream, the text emphasizes the comprehensive scope of the *Tantrāloka*'s synthesis.

The author then addresses a potential point of contention: the assertion that the *Tantrāloka* encompasses all six streams while not explicitly citing texts from each tradition. While acknowledging that Abhinavagupta might not directly quote from the *Buddhatantra* or *Garuḍatantra*, the text argues that these teachings are effectively subsumed within the broader *Dakṣiṇasrotas* literature, particularly those texts closely related to the Trika system. The Trika system, a prominent school within Kashmiri Shaivism, plays a pivotal role in Abhinavagupta's thought, and its influence is evident in his approach to synthesizing these diverse streams.The text implies that while Abhinavagupta may not give equal weight to all six streams, their essence is nonetheless present within the textual corpus he engages with, contributing to the *Tantrāloka*'s comprehensive understanding of Śaivism. 

### III. Maheśvara: TheShadowy Guru

The text now introduces a more enigmatic figure: Maheśvara, a guru who played a crucial role in shaping Abhinavagupta's understanding of Śaivism. Described as a "shadowy figure," Maheśvara's teachings, while influential, are shroudedin a degree of mystery. Jayaratha, the commentator on the *Tantrāloka*, provides valuable insights into this elusive guru. He reveals that Maheśvara is identified by different names, including Parameśvara and Īśa, perhaps reflecting the multifaceted nature of his teachings or the poeticlicense employed for metrical purposes in the source text. This ambiguity surrounding Maheśvara's identity adds a layer of intrigue, prompting us to piece together his significance through fragmented references and interpretations.

Abhinavagupta himself, in a lost work cited by Jayaratha, provides a glimpse into Maheśvara's role as his guru. He speaks of a "triple guru lineage" that nourished his understanding of the Trika teachings. This lineage consists of:

1. **Tradition of the *Siddhas*:** This lineage, stretching from the goddess Bhatṭārikā to Bhūti, represents a line of accomplished practitioners who attained spiritual liberation. The term *Siddha* refers to these perfected beings, often attributed with supernatural abilities and profound spiritual insights. The transmission from Bhatṭārikā, a fierce form of the goddess Shakti, suggests a strong Tantric orientation.

2.***Śrīśāntana***: This lineage connects the figure of Bhaṭṭa to Parameśa, highlighting a transmission focused on the worship of Śrī, a term often associated with Lakshmi, the goddess of prosperity, but in this context likely refers to a form of Shakti. 

3. **Supreme Guru Lineage:** This lineage, also originating from Bhaṭṭa but culminating in Īśa (another name for Shiva), suggests a transmission emphasizing the supremacy of Shiva as the ultimate reality.

Unraveling the precise nature and interrelationship of these lineages requires careful consideration of the textual clues.For instance, the *Krama* tradition, characterized by its focus on the dynamic interplay of manifestation and dissolution, is explicitly linked to the first lineage, suggesting a possible connection between *Krama* practices and the teachings of the *Siddhas*.

### IV. The *Parātriṃśikā*/*Triśikā* System and Maheśvara's Role

The source text reveals Maheśvara's pivotal role in transmitting a specific system of thought based on the *Parātriṃśikā*, a Tantric text also known as the *Triśikā*. Abhinavagupta, in his commentary on the *Parātriṃśikā* titled *Parātriṃśikāvivaraṇa*, provides a detailed and insightful exposition of this system. Notably, he prefers the term *Triśikā*, meaning "Tantra of the three goddesses," highlighting theimportance of the divine feminine principle within this tradition. 

The source text underscores Maheśvara's role as Abhinavagupta's primary teacher in the "**system of the uh Trika the Kaula system of the Trika taught in the *Parātriṃśikā* or*Triṃśikā***." This statement reveals a few crucial points. Firstly, it establishes a connection between Maheśvara's teachings and the *Kaula* tradition, a branch of Tantric Shaivism known for its esoteric practices and emphasis on the transformative power of ritual experience. Secondly, itlinks this *Kaula* system specifically to the *Trika* school. This suggests that Maheśvara's transmission, while rooted in *Kaula* practices, found its expression within the sophisticated philosophical framework of the *Trika*.

The source text cites "**three passages**" from Abhinavagupta's writings that solidify Maheśvara's position as his guru in this specific tradition. While these passages aren't quoted directly, their existence strengthens the argument that Maheśvara played a formative role in shaping Abhinavagupta's understanding of the *Trika*through the lens of *Kaula* practices.

### V. The Śrīnāthasāntāna: A Śākta Tradition

The text delves further into the *Śrīnāthasāntāna* (also referred to as *Śrīśāntāna*), a lineage closely associatedwith Maheśvara. While less prominent than other lineages discussed, the *Śrīnāthasāntāna* provides valuable insights into the diversity of Śaiva traditions. 

The source text connects Maheśvara to the *Śrīnāthasāntāna*, raising questions about thelineage's specific doctrines and practices. Evidence suggests a strong *Śākta* orientation, meaning that the divine feminine principle, often embodied as a goddess, holds a central position within this tradition. This *Śākta* influence is apparent in the lineage's veneration of Macchanda, a name associatedwith both Shiva and a class of Tantric texts, and Bhagadattanātha, a rarely encountered figure who combines the name of Bhagadatta, a mythical king from Assam, with the epithet "nātha," signifying a spiritual master. 

The prominence of Bhagadatta in this context is particularly intriguing. In the *Mahābhārata*, an epic Hindu text, Bhagadatta is depicted as the valiant king of Prāgjyotiṣa, a kingdom often identified with Assam. Known for his prowess in elephant warfare, Bhagadatta's inclusion in the *Śrīnāthasāntāna* hints at the assimilation of local deities and heroes into the broader pantheon of Tantric Shaivism. This integration speaks to the adaptability and syncretic nature of Tantric traditions, which often absorbed and reinterpreted existing beliefs and practices.

The text further strengthens the argument for the *Śrīnāthasāntāna*'s *Śākta* leanings by citing the presence of "**feminine vocatives**" in its initiation rituals. These vocatives, grammatical constructs used to directly address a female entity, strongly suggest that the central deity of this lineage is a goddess. 

Furthermore, the *mantras* (sacred syllables or verses) employed within the *Śrīnāthasāntāna* reveal traces of *Kaula* influence. These *mantras*, characterized by the recurring elements of *Hrīm* and *Śrīm*, both seed syllables associated with Shakti, and the term *Nāthapāda*, often translated as "at the feet of the master," point toward a tradition that venerates both the divine feminine and a lineage of realized masters. 

The source text notes that while the *Śrīnāthasāntāna* itself seems to have faded into obscurity, leaving behindno known scriptures or commentaries, remnants of its rituals persisted in Kashmiri traditions. This survival is evident in the use of three specific *mantras* during the funeral rites for deceased initiates. The recitation of these *mantras* while carrying the body to the cremation ground suggests an association with the transition between life and death, a theme often explored within Tantric traditions.

### VI. Bhūtirāja: Guru of the *Krama*

The narrative shifts to Bhūtirāja, another significant guru who played a pivotal role in Abhinavagupta's intellectual journey. The text posits that "**Bhūtirāja is a guru of the *Krama* and taught the *Krama* to Abhinavagupta**," emphasizing Bhūtirāja's expertise in this esoteric tradition.

The *Krama*, a term often translated as "sequence" or "process," represents a sophisticated system of Tantric practice that emphasizes the dynamic interplay between manifestation and dissolution. Central to the *Krama* is the understanding that the universe arises from and ultimately dissolves back into the Supreme Consciousness, often symbolized as Shiva or Shakti. Through specific practices, including meditation, visualization, and ritual action, *Krama* practitioners aimto experience this cosmic dance of creation and dissolution within their own being, ultimately leading to liberation.

The text presents a compelling argument for Bhūtirāja's role as Abhinavagupta's *Krama* guru, citing several pieces of evidence:

1. ***Tantrāloka* Commentary:** Even Jayaratha, who, as the text suggests, may have had reasons to downplay Bhūtirāja's influence, acknowledges the existence of a different deity system within Bhūtirāja's *Krama* lineage. This alternative system, centered on the *Pañcaśāṭaka*, a group of five goddesses, further supports the notion that Bhūtirāja held a unique and influential position within the *Krama* tradition.

2. ***Mahārthamāñjarīparimala***: This 14th-century South Indian text quotes Bhūtirāja directly, revealing his deep understanding of *mantra* and its connection to the goddess. Bhūtirāja's statement, "**'The mantra is the goddess herself since it holds everything within herself itself,'**" reflects a core principle of *Krama* and many Tantric traditions: the*mantra* is not merely a sound or word but embodies the very essence and power of the deity it represents.

3. ***Tantrasāra***: In this work, Abhinavagupta explicitly refers to Bhūtirāja as "**śrībhūtirāja-guravaḥ**," an honorific title that clearly establishes Bhūtirāja as his teacher. He quotes Bhūtirāja's explanation of the name "Kāli," a fierce form of Shakti, as deriving from the root *kal*, which signifies "to project," "to know," and "to besubject to counting." This etymological analysis, drawing upon the Pāṇinian system of Sanskrit grammar, demonstrates both Bhūtirāja's linguistic proficiency and his ability to uncover deeper layers of meaning within seemingly simple terms.

4. ***Tantrāloka-vivecana***:Jayaratha, despite his potential reservations, cites a lost text on *Krama* lineages that explicitly identifies Bhūtirāja as the disciple of Cakrabāṇu, a prominent *Krama* master, and the teacher of Abhinavagupta. This external confirmation strengthens the argument for Bhūtirāja's significant role in transmitting *Krama* teachings to Abhinavagupta.

5. **Old Kashmiri *mahānāya-prakāśa*:** This text provides a poetic description of the *Krama* lineage, tracing it back to the goddess Maṅgalā,a key figure associated with this tradition. The verse describes how Maṅgalā received the teachings at the sacred Pīṭha of Oḍḍiyāna, a location often associated with esoteric Buddhist and Tantric traditions, indicating a possible point of convergence between these lineages. The lineage then descends through a seriesof human gurus, culminating in Cakrabāṇu, described as having eight disciples, one of whom was Bhūtirāja, further solidifying Bhūtirāja's position within this lineage.

The text delves into the intricacies of the Old Kashmiri language used in the *mahānāya-prakāśa*, highlighting the term "**araññe,**" which denotes a female Śākta adept. This term underscores the importance of women as practitioners and lineage holders within the *Krama* tradition.

Having established Bhūtirāja's credentials as a *Krama* master and Abhinavagupta's guru, the text turns toward analyzing the *Gītārthasaṅgraha*, Abhinavagupta's commentary on the *Bhagavadgītā*. The text proposes that Bhūtirāja was Abhinavagupta's guiding influence during the composition of thissignificant work.

### VII. Bhūtirāja and the *Gītārthasaṅgraha*

The text argues that "**Bhūtirāja was Abhinavagupta's guru at the time that he wrote the *Gītārthasaṅgraha*,**" aproposition supported by various textual and contextual clues. 

The *Gītārthasaṅgraha*, as the name suggests, is a "summary" or "collection of the meanings" of the *Bhagavadgītā*. It's not a verse-by-verse commentary but rather focuses on keypassages and themes within the *Gītā*, interpreting them through the lens of *Krama* philosophy.

The opening verse of the *Gītārthasaṅgraha* provides crucial information regarding the lineage of transmission that led to its composition. The lineage begins with Kacchāṇa, a renowned grammarian often compared to Pāṇini, indicating a strong foundation in Sanskrit language and its subtle nuances. The lineage then passes to Śauśuka, a figure whose historicity is debated but nonetheless represents a link in the chain of transmission. Finally, the lineage reaches Bhūtirāja, described as a "**Brahman**" who "**rescued those who are sunk in darkness, as by the sun, as by Cakrabāṇu**. This description positions Bhūtirāja as a luminous figure who dispels ignorance and guides individuals toward spiritual awakening, drawing a parallel between his role and that of Cakrabāṇu, his own guru and a prominent figure in the *Krama* lineage.

The verse concludes by naming Abhinavagupta as the author of the *Gītārthasaṅgraha*, characterizing him as a "**bee drinking the nectar from the lotuses that are [Bhūtirāja's] feet.**" This imagery beautifully portrays the student-teacher relationship, with Abhinavagupta, the eager learner, absorbing the wisdom imparted by Bhūtirāja.

The text proposes that the *Gītārthasaṅgraha* represents an early phase in Abhinavagupta's writing career. Several factors support this claim:

1. **Simple Style:** Compared to his later, more complex works like the *Triśikāvivāraṇa* and *Tantrāloka*, the *Gītārthasaṅgraha* exhibits a simpler and more direct style, suggesting a less mature stage of writing.

2. **Absence of Esoteric Discussions:** The *Gītārthasaṅgraha* refrains from delving into the complex philosophical debates and esoteric practices that characterize Abhinavagupta's later works, further supporting its categorization as an earlier piece.

3. **Limited Citations:** The *Gītārthasaṅgraha* cites a narrower range of texts compared to Abhinavagupta's later works, suggesting a less extensive engagement with the vast corpus of philosophical and Tantric literature.

4. **Authorial Modesty:**Abhinavagupta displays a degree of humility in the *Gītārthasaṅgraha* that contrasts with the self-assured tone of his later writings. This difference in tone further points towards an earlier stage in his intellectual development.

The text highlights a passage from the *Gītārthasaṅgraha* where Abhinavagupta acknowledges his "limited intellect" and emphasizes his reliance on his guru's instructions. This confession of intellectual humility further reinforces the notion that the *Gītārthasaṅgraha* was written during a period when Abhinavagupta was stillheavily reliant on his guru's guidance, likely Bhūtirāja.

Furthermore, the text argues that the *Gītārthasaṅgraha*'s doctrinal focus aligns more closely with the *Krama* tradition than with the *Trika* system, despite Abhinavagupta not explicitly identifyingthe tradition by name. This alignment is evident in how Abhinavagupta interprets certain *Gītā* verses through the lens of *Krama* philosophy. 

### VIII. The *Krama* in the *Gītārthasaṅgraha*: Interpreting the *Devāḥ*The text focuses on a specific verse from the *Bhagavadgītā* (3.11) to illustrate how Abhinavagupta's commentary in the *Gītārthasaṅgraha* reflects a strong *Krama* influence:

> "*Devān bhāvayatā-nena te devā bhāvaya-yāntu vaḥ parasparaṃ bhāvayaṃtaḥ śreyaḥ paramavapsyatha*."

This verse, often translated as "Cherish the gods with this sacrifice, and may the gods cherish you; thus nourishing one another, you shall attainto the supreme good," presents a seemingly straightforward message of reciprocal relationship between humans and the divine. 

However, Abhinavagupta, drawing upon the esoteric teachings of the *Krama*, unveils a deeper layer of meaning within this verse. He interprets the term "**devāḥ**" (gods) not as external deities but as the senses themselves, specifically the "**kāraṇeśvarīs,**" the goddesses residing within the sense faculties (**kāraṇāḥ**). This interpretation reflects a key principle of *Krama* philosophy: the divine is not separate from the world but immanent within it, even within the seemingly mundane realm of sensory experience.

Abhinavagupta explains that by "**gratifying the gods**," the *Gītā* encourages individuals to fully engage with the objects of the senses, to immerse themselves in the richness of sensory experience. This approach, however, doesn't advocate for unrestrained indulgence. Instead, it emphasizes a conscious and mindful engagement with the senses, recognizing that even within the realm of sensory perception, the divine can be experienced. 

Abhinavagupta then explains that when the senses ("**goddesses**") are fully engaged and "**gratified**," they, in turn, "**gratify**" consciousness. This reciprocal gratification leads to a "**momentary liberation of the self in the form of its coming to rest within its own true nature alone.**" This statement hints at the *Krama* understanding of liberation as not a distant goalbut a momentary experience that occurs when the individual consciousness recognizes its inherent unity with the Supreme Consciousness. This realization arises not by withdrawing from the world but by fully engaging with it, experiencing even sensory perception as a manifestation of the divine.

Abhinavagupta further elaborates that by maintaining this constant interplay between extroversion (engaging with the senses) and introversion (coming to rest in one's true nature), a state of "**mutual gratification**" is achieved. This ongoing cycle, experienced from moment to moment, ultimately leads to the "**ultimate good**" or liberation, where the duality between subject and object, perceiver and perceived, dissolves into the unity of pure consciousness. 

### IX. The *Devīstotravrivr̥ti* and the Cosmic Form

The text explores another fascinating aspect of the *Krama*'s presence in the *Gītārthasaṅgraha*—its connectionto the eleventh chapter of the *Bhagavadgītā*, where Krishna reveals his awe-inspiring cosmic form (*viśvarūpa*).

Abhinavagupta states that the eleventh chapter's "**secret teaching**" revolves around the cosmic processes of emanation and resorption. This statement alignsperfectly with *Krama* philosophy, which emphasizes the continuous flow of manifestation (emanation) and dissolution (resorption) as fundamental to the universe's fabric. He further explains that this process can be directly experienced through the cycle of grasping and abandoning objects of awareness, highlighting a core practice within the *Krama* tradition.

Abhinavagupta then directs readers to his commentary on the "Hymn to the Goddess" (*Devīstotravrivr̥ti*) for a more detailed exposition of this concept, claiming to have already elaborated on this teaching in that work. This reference to the *Devīstotravrivr̥ti* is crucial as it suggests a potential link between this lost commentary and another lost work: the *Kramakalikā*, literally "the play of the *Krama*."

The text proposes that the *Devīstotravrivr̥ti* is actually an alternative title forAbhinavagupta's commentary on the *Kramastotra*, a hymn dedicated to the *kālikā*s, the various manifestations of the goddess Kāli within the *Krama* system. This hypothesis rests on the argument that the *Kramastotra* can be considered a "Hymn to the Goddess" and that Abhinavagupta's commentary likely provided a detailed exposition of the *Krama* principles embedded within it.

The text dismisses the proposition by K.C. Pandey, an Indologist, who suggested that the *Devīstotravrivr̥ti* mightbe Abhinavagupta's commentary on Caitanya's *Durgāstotra*. This dismissal stems from the argument that Caitanya's *Durgāstotra*, while undoubtedly a hymn to the goddess, lacks the specific Tantric context that would align with Abhinavagupta's focus on the *Krama*.

Therefore, the text posits that the *Kramakalikā*, Abhinavagupta's lost commentary on the *Kramastotra*, served as the platform for his detailed exploration of the cosmic emanation and resorption process, a teaching healluded to in the *Gītārthasaṅgraha*. This connection between the *Gītārthasaṅgraha* and the *Kramakalikā* further strengthens the argument for the *Krama*'s significant influence on Abhinavagupta's early writings.

The text thenanalyzes a passage from the eleventh chapter of the *Bhagavadgītā*, where Arjuna, after witnessing Krishna's cosmic form, proclaims that Krishna is the eternal guardian of the *sātvata dharma* (the righteous path of the *sātvatas*). 

While traditionally interpreted as referring tothe devotional path of the *vaiṣṇavas* (worshippers of Vishnu), Abhinavagupta, drawing upon the *Krama* perspective, offers a different interpretation. He defines *sātvatas* as those who embrace both "*sat*" (that which is) and "*tatvam*"(the ultimate reality). "*Sat*," according to Abhinavagupta, represents the realm of manifestation, the world of differentiation and multiplicity experienced through action and cognition. "*Tatvam*," on the other hand, signifies the non-dual reality, the underlying unity of pure consciousness from which the manifested world arises.

Abhinavagupta argues that the true *sātvata dharma* transcends any specific religious path. Instead, it encompasses both the realm of manifestation (*sat*) and the ultimate non-dual reality (*tatvam*), recognizing that both are essential aspects of existence. He further explainsthat the true *sātvata* is one who understands and experiences the continuous cycle of grasping and abandoning objects of awareness. This statement highlights the importance of the *Krama* practice of engaging with the world while simultaneously recognizing its ephemeral nature and the underlying unity of consciousness.

Abhinavagupta reiterates that he has already explained this concept extensively in his *Devīstotravrivr̥ti*, emphasizing the importance of this lost work for understanding his interpretation of the *Gītā*'s eleventh chapter.

### X. The *Kramakalikā*: Evidence and Significance

The text delves deeper intothe significance of the *Kramakalikā*, Abhinavagupta's lost commentary, and its role in illuminating his understanding of the *Krama* tradition. 

The text cites the *Mahārthamañjarīparimala*, a 14th-century South Indian *Krama* text composed by Maheśvarānandanātha. This text provides crucial evidence supporting the claim that Abhinavagupta's *Devīstotravrivr̥ti* is, in fact, his lost *Kramakalikā*.

In the concluding verse of the *Mahārthamañjarī*, Maheśvarānandanātha states that the profound teachings he has expounded, including his unique interpretation of Krishna's revelation in the *Bhagavadgītā*, are rooted in the *Kramakalikā* of "**the famous and revered Brahmin Abhinavaguptānātha.**" This explicit reference to Abhinavagupta's *Kramakalikā* as the source of his teachings leaves little doubt that the *Devīstotravrivr̥ti*, which Abhinavagupta himself references in relation to this teaching, is none otherthan the *Kramakalikā*. 

The text then unpacks the *Kramakalikā*'s interpretation of Krishna's cosmic form, revealing a profound insight into the nature of spiritual experience and transmission. It explains that when Krishna reveals his *viśvarūpa* to Arjuna, he's not merely displaying a grand spectacle but entering a profound state of meditative absorption in the goddess Kālasaṅkarṣiṇī. 

Kālasaṅkarṣiṇī, whose name literally means "she who absorbs time," represents a fierce and powerful aspect of the goddess, often associated with thedissolution of the universe and the transcendence of temporal limitations. By merging his consciousness with Kālasaṅkarṣiṇī, Krishna accesses the very source of creation and dissolution, embodying the dynamic interplay of *śakti* (power) that underpins the *Krama* worldview. 

The text furtherelaborates that Krishna achieves this state of absorption through the *kecarīmudrā*, an advanced yogic technique that involves directing energy to specific points within the body. This technique allows Krishna to fully access the "**kaulā* ground,**" a term referring to the ultimate reality of pure consciousnessfrom which the universe emanates and into which it dissolves. 

By revealing his cosmic form while in this state of heightened awareness, Krishna transmits a profound spiritual experience directly to Arjuna. This transmission, according to the *Kramakalikā*, constitutes an initiation into the *Krama* tradition. Through this directexperience of Krishna's merged consciousness with the divine feminine principle, Arjuna receives a visceral understanding of the *Krama*'s core teachings. 

This interpretation highlights the importance of direct transmission from guru to disciple within Tantric traditions. The *Kramakalikā* argues that mere intellectual understanding of the *Krama* philosophy is insufficient for true realization. Instead, it's through direct experience, facilitated by the guru's grace and skillful means, that the disciple awakens to the reality of their own divine nature. 

### XI. Conclusion: Abhinavagupta's Development and the Hierarchy of Revelation

Thetext concludes by synthesizing the evidence presented, offering a compelling narrative of Abhinavagupta's intellectual development and the evolving hierarchy of revelation within his thought.

The text reiterates the significant influence of Bhūtirāja on Abhinavagupta's early career, particularly during the period when the *Krama* tradition held a central position in his understanding of Shaivism. 

During this phase, Abhinavagupta produced several notable *Krama*-focused works, including the *Kramakalikā* (also known as the *Devīstotravrivr̥ti*) and his *Krama*-based commentary on the *Bhagavadgītā*, the *Gītārthasaṅgraha*. These early writings demonstrate Abhinavagupta's deep engagement with the *Krama*'s philosophy and practices, positioning it as the pinnacle of spiritual attainment.

The text then highlights a shiftin Abhinavagupta's focus as his career progressed. While the *Krama* remained a significant influence, his attention shifted towards the *Trika* system, a sophisticated school of Kashmiri Shaivism that provided a comprehensive framework for understanding the nature of reality and the path to liberation.This shift, however, doesn't imply a complete abandonment of the *Krama*. Instead, Abhinavagupta seems to have integrated his *Krama* insights into his understanding of the *Trika*. This integration is evident in his magnum opus, the *Tantrāloka*, where hepresents the *Trika* as the ultimate culmination of spiritual revelation while subtly weaving in *Krama* principles throughout his exposition.

The text contrasts Abhinavagupta's mature view with that of his disciple Kṣemarāja, who maintained a more traditional hierarchy of revelation, placing the *Krama*at the pinnacle. Kṣemarāja's view, characterized by the phrase "**Vedādi-kramānta**" (beginning with the Vedas and culminating in the *Krama*), reflects a more linear understanding of spiritual evolution, with the *Krama* representing the final and most esoteric stage.

Abhinavagupta, however, presents a more nuanced perspective. While acknowledging the importance of the Vedas and other scriptural traditions, he positions the *Trika* as the most comprehensive and inclusive system. Within his *Trika* framework, the *Krama* occupies a significant place, not as a separate orsuperior system but as an integral aspect of the *Trika*'s multifaceted understanding of reality and liberation.

In this sense, Abhinavagupta's mature view diverges from the mainstream, as represented by Kṣemarāja's more traditional stance. His emphasis on the *Trika* as theultimate system reflects a unique synthesis, one that assimilates the profound insights of the *Krama* within a broader philosophical framework.

The text concludes by highlighting the significance of Abhinavagupta's intellectual journey. His evolving understanding of the *Krama*, from his early focus on its esoteric practices toits eventual integration within the *Trika* system, provides valuable insights into the dynamic nature of spiritual development.
