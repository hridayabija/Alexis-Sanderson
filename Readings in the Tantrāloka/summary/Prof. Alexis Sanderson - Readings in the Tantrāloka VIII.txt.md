##Unveiling the Hidden History of the Trika Tradition in Kashmir

Professor Sanderson's final lecture on the *Trika Loka* takes us on a journeythrough time, seeking to illuminate the presence and nature of the *Trika* tradition in Kashmir before the renowned scholar Abhinavagupta. While Abhinavagupta's works, dating roughly around 1000 AD, provide a wealth of knowledge about the *Trika*, Professor Sanderson aims topush beyond this timeframe and delve into the tradition's earlier roots. 

### The Significance of Early Evidence

The absence of surviving learned Shaiva texts from early Kashmir (before the 9th century) presents a challenge in tracing the*Trika*'s history. However, Professor Sanderson turns to a remarkable source: the *Haravijaya Mahākāvya*. This epic poem, composed around the early 9th century, is a testament to the literary brillianceof its author, Raṭnākara. Spanning an impressive five and a half thousand verses, the *Haravijaya* narrates the mythological tale of the slaying and liberation of the titan Aṇḍaka by the ferocious goddess Chaṇḍī. 

The 47th chapter, ahymn dedicated to Chaṇḍī, holds particular significance for Professor Sanderson's investigation. This hymn showcases a unique approach to praising the goddess by portraying her as the absolute reality within various philosophical and soteriological systems prevalent in Kashmir at that time. This comprehensive approach offers a glimpse into the diverse religious landscape of 9th-century Kashmir.

Professor Sanderson notes the notable absence of Jainism in this panorama of traditions, aligning with other historical evidence suggesting that Jainism remained a marginal presence in Kashmir. Conversely, the *Haravijaya* reveals a deep and respectful engagement with Buddhist traditions. This points to a period where Buddhism andBrahmanism thrived side by side, enjoying patronage from rulers and fostering intellectual exchange between scholars.

### Unmasking the Trika in the Śākta Verses

Within the *Haravijaya*'s celebration of diverse traditions, Professor Sanderson identifies a set of verses that reveal not just an awareness but a detailed knowledge ofthe *Trika* tradition. These verses, embedded within the *śākta* material of the hymn, provide the crucial early evidence for understanding the *Trika* before Abhinavagupta.

**Verse 1: A Tapestry of Light, Sound, and Transcendence**

_Jyotirmayīṃ akaraṇendriyavṛttim ādyāṃ haṃsākṣarasthitimayīṃ viśṛtāmṛtaughaṃ śrīkaṇṭamukhyaguruṣoḍaśavīramūrtim utphullaśaktikamalāsanatāmupetām._

This densely packed verse paints a vivid picture of the goddess Chaṇḍī as the embodiment of pure light and consciousness (*Jyotirmayīm*), transcending the limitations of mental and sensory activity (*akaraṇendriyavṛtim*). She embodies the presence ofthe *haṃsākṣara* (*haṃsākṣarasthitimayīm*), a mystical sound representing the union of Shiva and Shakti. 

The phrase _viśṛtāmṛtaughaṃ_, meaning "a flowing forth of nectar," introduces a layer of esoteric symbolism. Inthe *Mantraśāstra* (the science of mantras) within this tradition, nectar (*amṛta*) serves as a code word for the letter 's'. This establishes the first two letters of a significant *bīja mantra*. 

The verse continues by describing the goddess as the16th hero (*guruṣoḍaśavīramūrtim*), the first being Śrīkaṇṭha. This cryptic reference becomes clear within the context of *Trika* cosmology. The 16 heroes represent the 16 vowels of the Sanskrit alphabet, starting with 'a' (represented by Śrīkaṇṭha) and culminating in 'aḥ' (visarga), the 16th vowel. This signifies the presence of the sound 'aḥ' in the hidden *mantra*.

Finally, the verse describes the goddess as having a lotus throne (*kamalāsanatām*) formed by the fully expanded *śakti* (*utphullaśakti*). The fully opened lotus symbolizes the ultimate expansion of creative power, represented by the vowel 'au' in the *Trika* system. 

This careful analysis reveals the embedded *bīja mantra*: **hasauau**. The fact that the poet could subtly weave this esoteric *mantra* into the verse, letter by letter, suggests a profound understanding of the *Trika*. Moreover, the verse hints at the likelihood that the intended audience possessed at least a rudimentary familiarity with these concepts, allowing them to grasp the deeperlayers of meaning.

**Verse 2: The Radiance of Consciousness and the Dance of Shakti**

_Śaktitrayapratiṭaśūlakarāṃ śivāyā dhamanā jaganti sakalānyavabhāsayantīṃ kalolasaṃkulaparāmṛtasaṃpadamtvaṃ jāyantī bhairavataṃ kila kaulikāstā._

This verse elaborates on the dynamic interplay between *śiva* and *śakti*. It portrays the goddess as wielding a trident (*śūla*) manifested by the three *śaktis* (*śaktitrayapratiṭa*), representing the fundamental forces of will (*icchāśakti*), knowledge (*jñānaśakti*), and action (*kriyāśakti*). These *śaktis*, inseparable from *śiva*, are responsible for the emanation and perception of the universe. The goddess, through her radiance (*dhamanā*), illuminates all worlds (*jaganti sakalāni*), revealing them within the field of consciousness (*avabhāsayantīm*).

The verse concludes by stating that the *Kaulikas* (*kaulikāstā*)—practitioners of the Kaula tradition,an esoteric branch of Shaivism—meditate upon the goddess in her *Bhairava* aspect (*bhairavataṃ*). This indicates a connection between the *Trika* tradition and the Kaula practices, which center around the worship of *Śiva* and *Śakti* in their various fierceforms.

**Verse 3: Attaining Lordship Through the Unchanging Ground of Bhairava**

_Janayam Kaulikā noyaṃ śakti-pātitām stira-bhairavāṅkavṛtim parāpara-vibhedavātim_.

This verse shiftsthe focus from the goddess to the practitioners, revealing the soteriological goal of the *Trika* path. The verse begins with the declaration, "We, the *Kaulikas*…" (*Janayam Kaulikā noyaṃ*), clearly identifying the speakers as initiates into this tradition. It suggests asense of shared identity and purpose amongst those who engage in this path.

The verse then describes the state they aspire to achieve: _śakti-pātitām_. This translates to "lordship over *śakti*," indicating a state of mastery and union with the divine feminine principle. This mastery doesn't imply control over *śakti* as an external force but signifies a profound identification and harmonious alignment with the dynamic energy of consciousness itself. 

The practitioners attain this state by aligning their awareness with the unchanging ground of *Bhairava* (*stira-bhairavāṅkavṛtim*). *Bhairava* represents the unchanging, absolute consciousness, the ultimate reality that serves as the backdrop for the dance of *śakti*. By merging their awareness with this unchanging ground, practitioners transcend limitations and experience the dynamism of reality from a place of unshakeable stability.

The verse further clarifies that this state of_śakti-pātitām_ encompasses both the transcendent (*parā*) and the immanent (*aparā*) aspects of reality (_parāpara-vibhedavātim_). This highlights the non-dual nature of the *Trika*, where the ultimate reality is not separate from the manifestworld but permeates and infuses every aspect of existence.

**Verse 4: Visualizing the Triśūlābjamaṇḍala**

_cakrāśritātriśikākoṭigatāravinda-satkarṇikāsanagatāṃ tvām_.

The final verse in this set provides crucial visual imagery central to the *Trika* tradition. It directs practitioners to meditate upon the goddess residing within a specific *maṇḍala*: the *Triśūlābjamaṇḍala*. 

This *maṇḍala* features a trident (*triśikā*) at its center, each of its three points adorned with a lotus (*āravinda*). The goddess is visualized as being seated (*āsanagatāṃ*) upon the pericarp (*satkarṇikā*) of these lotuses. The entire *maṇḍala* issituated within a circular structure (*cakrāśritā*), symbolizing the all-encompassing nature of reality.

This vivid description of the *Triśūlābjamaṇḍala* reveals the author's familiarity with a key visual representation of the *Trika* tradition. Moreover, itindicates that this *maṇḍala* likely served as a focal point for meditation and ritual practices within this lineage. The author's ability to evoke this imagery through his words suggests that his audience, too, would have recognized and connected with the significance of the *Triśūlābjamaṇḍala*.### Dating the Haravijaya and the Significance of Early Evidence

Establishing a precise date for the *Haravijaya* is crucial in understanding the chronology of the *Trika* tradition in Kashmir. While Kalhaṇa's *Rājatarangiṇī*, a historical chronicle of Kashmir, mentionsthe *Haravijaya*'s patron, King Chippaṭa Jayapāda, the chronology provided is initially vague. However, by cross-referencing with other historical sources like the *Tangshu*, the official annals of the Tang Dynasty, Professor Sanderson arrives at a more accurate timeframe for King Chippaṭa Jayapāda's reign: 826 AD to 838 AD. This suggests that the *Haravijaya* was likely composed during this period, placing it firmly within the early 9th century.

The significance of this dating cannot be overstated. The *Haravijaya*, with its detailed references to the *Trika*, predates Abhinavagupta's works by nearly two centuries. This challenges the assumption that Abhinavagupta's writings are the sole or primary source for understanding the *Trika*. Instead, it reveals a vibrant and established traditionalready flourishing in Kashmir during the early 9th century, laying the groundwork for the later elaborations of Abhinavagupta and his contemporaries.

### Delving Deeper: Identifying the Specific Trika Lineage

Having established the presence of the *Trika* in early Kashmir, Professor Sanderson moves beyond generalizations andattempts to identify the specific lineage represented in the *Haravijaya*. This meticulous approach highlights the diversity within the *Trika* tradition, cautioning against viewing it as a monolithic entity.

Professor Sanderson points to the existence of different *Trika* lineages, each with unique characteristics. For instance, the *Tantrasadbhāvatantra* emphasizes the worship of *Bhairava* and the goddess in *Ardhanārīśvara* form, a depiction absent in Abhinavagupta's *Trika*. The *Mālinīvijayottara*, which forms the basis for Abhinavagupta's *Tantrāloka*, focuses on the three goddesses residing on the trident of the *Triśūlābjamaṇḍala*. Conversely, the *Devīyāgamala*, a lost text with a strong *Krama* orientation (another significant tradition within Kashmir Shaivism), introduces a fourth transcendent goddess, Kālasaṃkarṣiṇī.

Amidst this diversity, Professor Sanderson directs our attention to the *Triśirobhairava*, a lost scripture considered one of the three core texts of the *Trika*. While no complete manuscripts of the *Triśirobhairava* have surfaced, its fragments, quoted in later commentaries like Jayaratha's commentary on the *Tantrāloka*, offer glimpses into its unique perspective.

Unlike the ritualistic focus of some *Trika* texts, the *Triśirobhairava* emphasizes gnosis andesoteric practices. Its surviving fragments allude to profound meditations on subtle centers within the body, often employing obscure terminology that even Abhinavagupta found challenging to interpret fully. This suggests that the *Triśirobhairava* represents a highly sophisticated and perhaps intentionally veiled branch of the *Trika*, accessible onlyto initiates with the proper preparation and guidance.

### The Telltale Syllable: Connecting the Triśirobhairava to the Haravijaya

Professor Sanderson identifies a crucial link between the *Triśirobhairava* and the *Haravijaya*: the *bīja mantra* 'hasau', subtly revealed in the first verse of the analyzed set. This seemingly insignificant detail carries profound implications for understanding the lineage represented in the *Haravijaya*.

The syllable 'hasau' holds a unique position within the *Trika* tradition. It appears as the seed syllable of the goddess Parā, the highest reality in this system, exclusively in the *Triśirobhairava*. Other *Trika* texts, including the *Mālinīvijayottara*, *Siddhayogeśvarīmata*, and *Tantrasadbhāvatantra*, utilize the syllable 'sau' for Parā. The presence of 'hasau' in the *Haravijaya*, therefore, strongly suggests the influence of the *Triśirobhairava* on the text and its author.

Professor Sanderson further strengthens this connection by citing *Tantrāloka* 30, whereAbhinavagupta explicitly mentions 'hasau' as a variant taught in the *Triśirobhairava*. Jayaratha, in his commentary on this passage, confirms that this form represents the union of the vital breath ('ha') and the individual soul ('sa'), further demonstrating the esoteric knowledge embeddedwithin this syllable. 

Interestingly, 'hasau' resurfaces in later Kashmiri Śaiva ritual manuals used by priests serving Tantric families. For example, the *Kalpādikṣāpaddhati*, a 14th-century manual for Śaiva initiation, incorporates 'harsau' (a variation of 'hasau') when invoking Parā during fire sacrifices. This suggests a continuous, though perhaps less visible, lineage of the *Triśirobhairava* tradition in Kashmir, persisting alongside the more dominant lineages represented in texts like the *Tantrāloka*.The persistent use of 'harsau' challenges the assumption that prominent and widely circulated texts necessarily reflect the most prevalent practices of a tradition. Instead, it highlights the importance of considering lesser-known texts and ritual practices, often passed down through oral and esoteric lineages, to gain a more complete understanding of a tradition'shistorical development.

### The Intriguing Case of Mālinī and Parā: A Merging of Identities

Professor Sanderson's analysis of the *Haravijaya*'s verses uncovers another fascinating detail: the goddess described seems to embody characteristics of both Parā, the supreme goddess, andMālinī, the goddess of the *Trika*'s alphabet. This observation leads to a compelling proposition: the goddess depicted is Mālinī, but she embodies the qualities and potency of Parā. 

This merging of identities finds support in the practices documented in the anonymous ritual manuals of Kashmiri Śaiva priests. When performing fire sacrifices and making offerings to Parā as the goddess of the *pūrvāmnāya* (the lineage associated with the Kaula *Trika*), these priests identify her as Mālinī. They recite verses that address her as both Parā and Mālinī, signifyinga fusion of their identities within this ritual context.

One such verse, found in the *Kalpādikṣāpaddhati*, beautifully illustrates this merging:

_ātmāndu-dhāmani-yugeśa-nareśa-putra-citrāṁ-triśūla-viladhāmani-sṛṣṭi-śaktim vaiśargiketanacitidhāmanī-pundarīkām pañcit-parāṁ trika-parāṁ praṇamāmi śaktim_

"I bow before the goddess Parā,the inexpressible white *śakti* beyond the Triad, adorned by the presence of a retinue of the Lords of the Ages and the Princesses, who emits her power first in the moon center (the Self), then in the fontanel (the trident), and then in the ground of consciousness, whose natureis emission."

This verse addresses the goddess as both Parā (*trika-parāṁ*) and describes her manifestation through the imagery of the *Triśūlābjamaṇḍala* (the trident) and the moon center (associated with the letter 's', part of Parā's seedsyllable).

Further evidence for this merging comes from the *paścimāmnāya* tradition, a later branch of Kashmir Shaivism that draws upon and adapts earlier *Trika* concepts. The *Śrīmatottara*, a key text of the *paścimāmnāya*, assigns theseed syllable 'husrauṁ' to Mālinī. This syllable appears to be a variation of 'hausau', another form of Parā's seed syllable found in the *Triśirobhairava*. 

The *paścimāmnāya*, while drawing upon the *Trika*, seeksto assert its own unique identity. This is evident in its adaptation of the seed syllable, incorporating elements of the *Triśirobhairava*'s 'hausau' but transforming it into 'husrauṁ' for Mālinī. This highlights the dynamic and evolutionary nature of esoteric traditions, where concepts and practicesare transmitted, adapted, and reinterpreted over time.

### The Triad of nara-śakti-śiva: A Distinctive Trika Doctrine

As Professor Sanderson delves deeper into the *Haravijaya*'s verses, he arrives at another crucial piece of evidence confirming the text's connection tothe *Trika* tradition. This evidence lies in the final verse of the analyzed set, which explicitly mentions the triad of *nara*, *śakti*, and *śiva*:

_tat-tvaṁ bhavānī nara-śakti-śivātmakam yat etat-tridaśāstitam-uśanti-parāpara-jñā rudrānu-maṇḍala-malaṁ samabhūt tad aghā ajā matiṁ sanuvartanākaraṇe 'ha_

"You, Bhavānī, are this Triad of *nara*, *śakti*, and *śiva* that the all-knowing proclaim. It is you, the primal consciousness (*ādyā matiḥ*), that, enacting the will of the First Cause, have awakened the multitude of *Rudra* souls."

This verse unequivocally identifies the goddess Bhavānī (another name for the Divine Mother) with the triad of *nara-śakti-śiva*. This triad, Professor Sanderson emphasizes, represents a distinctive doctrine within the *Trika* tradition. It signifies the three fundamental modalities of one ultimate reality:

* **nara:** Represents the individualconsciousness, the limited sense of self often bound by duality and the illusion of separateness.
* **śakti:** Signifies the dynamic power of consciousness, the creative force responsible for manifestation, liberation, and the play of appearances.
* **śiva:** Embodies the unchanging, absolute consciousness, the groundof being from which *śakti* arises and to which it ultimately returns.

The *Trika*'s emphasis on *nara-śakti-śiva* as modalities of a single reality distinguishes it from other non-dual traditions that might posit a hierarchical relationship between these principles. In the *Trika*, these three are not separate entities but rather different expressions of the same underlying reality, much like the sun, its light, and its heat are inseparable aspects of a single phenomenon.

Professor Sanderson further highlights the significance of this triad by citing various sources where it is explicitly identified as a defining feature of the *Trika*. One such source is the *Triśikā-tātparyadīpikā*, a South Indian commentary on a commentary on the *Triśikā* (also known as *Parātriṁśikā*). Despite its challenging transmission and occasional textual inconsistencies, the *Triśikā-tātparyadīpikā* provides valuable insights into the evolution of the *Trika*. 

This commentary states:

_trikaṁ prakāśayām āsa nara-śakti-śivātmakam_ 

"Śiva has revealed through these scriptures theTriad of *nara, śakti,* and *śiva*."

This passage confirms the centrality of the *nara-śakti-śiva* triad to the understanding of the *Trika*. Interestingly, the *Triśikā-tātparyadīpikā* also hintsat a shift within the *Trika* tradition, specifically with the emergence of the *Triśikā* text itself. It suggests that while the earlier understanding focused on the *nara-śakti-śiva* triad as representing the individual soul, the power of manifestation, and the absolute consciousness, the*Triśikā* introduces a more refined interpretation.

In this later interpretation, the triad is reinterpreted in terms of the *object, means, and agent of cognition*. This shift, championed by Utpala, a prominent *Trika* philosopher, moves the focus from a more cosmological understanding toa nuanced exploration of the nature of experience and awareness itself. This reflects the dynamism of the *Trika* tradition, its ability to adapt, refine, and deepen its philosophical insights while remaining rooted in its core principles.

### Resisting Homogenization: The Importance of Differentiating Traditions

Professor Sanderson concludeshis lecture by emphasizing a crucial point that resonates throughout his exploration of the *Trika* tradition: the importance of resisting the tendency to homogenize and oversimplify. He cautions against collapsing diverse traditions into a single, undifferentiated mass, urging a more nuanced and historically grounded approach.

He argues that the pursuit ofunderstanding a tradition's history necessitates acknowledging its internal diversity. Just as a soup derives its flavor from the unique combination of its ingredients, a tradition's richness lies in the interplay of various lineages, texts, and interpretations. To truly comprehend a tradition like the *Trika*, we must be willing to unravelthe complexities of its historical development, recognizing the unique contributions of different lineages like the *Triśirobhairava* lineage, even if they haven't gained the same prominence as others.

Professor Sanderson's lecture provides a compelling example of how meticulous textual analysis, combined with a deep understanding of historical context andan openness to exploring lesser-known sources, can illuminate the hidden nuances of a tradition. By uncovering the influence of the *Triśirobhairava* in the *Haravijaya*, he challenges existing assumptions about the development of the *Trika* and reminds us that the most prominent voices do not alwaysrepresent the entirety of a tradition's story. His approach encourages us to approach the study of esoteric traditions with curiosity, humility, and a willingness to delve beyond the surface to uncover the richness and complexity that lie within.

###The Flame Within: Exploring the Symbolism of Śikhā

Professor Sanderson concludeshis exploration of the *Haravijaya*'s *Trika* versesby focusing on a final passage that introduces a potent symbol: *śikhā*, the flame. This symbol, drawn from the *Triśirobhairava*, adds another layer to our understanding of this lineage's unique perspective.

The verse in question reads:

*sarvāprapañcopaśama-nirvikalpa-śāntātivṛtta-paratattva-śivātma-vṛtti-sūkṣmātiśūkṣma-ghana-prakṛti-śikhā’tisaṃśupta-mandalagatā paridīpyase tvam*

"It is you that flare up, *paridīpyase tvam*, as *śikhā*, *śikhēti*, theflame, in the center of the circle of dreamless sleep. *saṃśupta-mandalagatā* in the circle of dreamless sleep."

This verse portrays the goddess as the radiant flame (*śikhā*) that blazes forth from the depths of dreamless sleep (*suṣupti*). This imagery connects to a profound understanding of consciousness within the *Trika* tradition.

Dreamless sleep, in this context, is not merely a state of unconsciousness but represents a merging with the undifferentiated ground of being, a temporary dissolution of the subject-object duality that characterizes waking and dreaming states. Thisstate, while seemingly inert, contains the potential for the arising of pure awareness.

The *śikhā*, the flame, symbolizes the sudden emergence of this pure awareness from within the depths of *suṣupti*. It represents a spontaneous awakening to one's true nature as *śiva*, the unchanging consciousnessthat precedes all thoughts, perceptions, and experiences. 

The verse further emphasizes the goddess's identification with *śiva* through the phrase _śivātma-vṛtti_, signifying a state of flowing in oneness with *śiva*. This merging with the absolute is not a distant goal but an ever-present reality, temporarily veiled by the fluctuations of the mind and senses. The *śikhā* serves as a potent reminder of this inherent unity, a flash of recognition that ignites from within the depths of our being.

Professor Sanderson clarifies the specific meaning of *śikhā* by referencing *Tantrāloka* 6, where Abhinavagupta, drawing upon the *Triśirobhairava*, explains:

"This vast hierarchy of manifestation, in its two modalities as processes and entities, is grounded in its entirety in the vital energy *prāṇe*. For what we mean byvital energy is much more than respiration and the other physiological processes of life. It is what has been termed *śikhā*, the flame, in the *Triśirōbhairava*."

Here, the concept of *śikhā* is linked to *prāṇa*, the vital energy thatanimates all of existence. However, *prāṇa*, in this context, is not merely the physical breath but represents a more subtle energy, the very force of consciousness itself. The *Triśirobhairava*, with its focus on esoteric practices, likely utilizes *śikhā* as afocal point for meditation, a means of transforming the gross *prāṇa* into its subtler, spiritual counterpart.

Abhinavagupta continues:

"This flame manifests itself externally as respiration, but when that has been bound up, *buddhā*, at such times as that of worship, itceases to oscillate, like the ordinary breath, and, as a result, becomes manifest in its inner nature as the power of consciousness that is *śiva* himself. *śivātmikā*, it becomes *śivātmikā*."

This passage reveals the transformative potential of workingwith *śikhā*. By consciously regulating the breath (*prāṇa*) through yogic practices, the practitioner can still the fluctuations of the mind and access the subtler dimensions of *prāṇa*. When the breath is bound (*buddhā*)—meaning restrained and consciously directed—the *śikhā*, the flame of pure awareness, spontaneously arises. This inner radiance, shining forth from within, reveals the true nature of reality as *śiva*, the absolute consciousness.

Professor Sanderson concludes his lecture with this evocative image of the *śikhā*, highlighting the *Triśirobhairava*'sunique contribution to understanding the path of liberation within the *Trika* tradition. The *śikhā* serves as a potent reminder that awakening is not a distant goal but an ever-present possibility, a flame waiting to be kindled from within the depths of our being. 

### Conclusion: Embracing the RichTapestry of the Trika

Professor Sanderson's exploration of the *Haravijaya*'s *Trika* verses has illuminated a fascinating and often overlooked chapter in the history of this rich tradition. By meticulously analyzing the text, he has unearthed compelling evidence for the presence of a vibrant *Trika* lineagein early 9th-century Kashmir, predating Abhinavagupta's influential works by nearly two centuries. 

His analysis of the *Haravijaya* has underscored several key points:

1. **The Importance of Early Evidence:** The *Haravijaya*, with its detailed referencesto *Trika* cosmology, practices, and deities, pushes back the timeline for understanding the tradition's development in Kashmir, demonstrating its vibrancy and sophistication centuries before Abhinavagupta.

2. **The Diversity Within the Trika:** The *Haravijaya*'s connection to the *Triśirobhairava*, a lesser-known but highly influential *Trika* scripture, highlights the tradition's internal diversity. It challenges the tendency to homogenize and encourages a more nuanced understanding of the various lineages and their unique contributions. 

3. **The Significance of Esoteric Symbolism:**The *Haravijaya*'s use of esoteric language, including *bīja mantras* and the symbolism of the *śikhā*, underscores the importance of delving into the deeper layers of meaning embedded within esoteric texts and practices.

4. **The Continuity of Tradition:** The presence of the*Triśirobhairava*'s influence in later Kashmiri Śaiva ritual manuals suggests a continuous, though often hidden, transmission of knowledge and practices across generations. It reminds us that the most prominent texts do not always represent the entirety of a tradition's living reality.

Professor Sanderson's lecture leavesus with a profound appreciation for the complexity and dynamism of the *Trika* tradition. It inspires us to approach the study of such traditions with an open mind, a willingness to explore less-traveled paths, and a deep respect for the subtle layers of meaning woven into the tapestry of esoteric knowledge. 

Byilluminating the hidden history of the *Trika*, Professor Sanderson invites us to engage with this rich tradition not as a static relic of the past, but as a living body of wisdom with the potential to awaken us to the depths of our own being.
